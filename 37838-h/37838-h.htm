<p class="b1 center">I</p>

<p>In an old number of <i>Punch</i>, under the heading "Society's
New Pet: The Artist's Model," is to be found
a drawing by Du Maurier, of which the descriptive text
runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"And how did you and Mr. Sopley come to quarrel, dear
Miss Dragon?"</p>

<p>"Well, your Grace, it was like this: I was sitting to him
in a cestus for 'The Judgment of Paris,' when someone
called as wished to see him most particular; so he said:
'Don't move, Miss Dragon, or you'll disturb the cestus.'
'Very good, sir,' I said, and off he went; and when he come
back in an hour and a 'alf or so he said: 'You've moved,
Miss Dragon!' 'I 'aven't!' I said. 'You '<i>ave</i>!' he said.
'I '<span class="smcap">aven't</span>!' I said&mdash;and no more I 'adn't, your Grace.
And with that I off with his cestus an' wished him good-morning,
an' I never been near him since!"
</p></div>

<p>Du Maurier may or may not have been wrong about the
newness of this craze of "Society's." If he was right, the
Honourable Emily Scarisbrick becomes at once a pioneer.
Let there be set down, here in the beginning, the plain facts
of how, a good ten years before the indignant Miss Dragon
"offed with" Mr. Sopley's cestus, the Honourable Emily
found a way to bridge the gulf that lies between Bohemia
and Mayfair.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>Except in the case of one person not yet born into these
pages, the report that the lady had engaged herself, early
in the year 1869, to "Mr. Buckley, her drawing-master,"
had only a short currency. It was probably devised by the
Honourable Emily herself in order to soften the blow for
her brother, Lord Moone. The real name of the man to
whom she engaged herself was James Buckley Causton.
Under this name he appears on the rolls of the 4th Dragoon
Guards as a trooper in the years 1862-1867; and as
"Buck" Causton he attained some celebrity when, in the
last-named year, he vanquished one Piker Betteridge in the
prize ring, in a battle which, beginning with gloves and
ending with bare knuckles, lasted for nearly nine hours.</p>

<p>For all we know, it may have been Miss Dragon's Mr.
Sopley who, seeing the magnificent Buck in the ring, first
put it into the ex-trooper's head to become an artists' model.
However it was, an artists' model he did become, and, as
such, the rage. No doubt Sopley, if it were he, would
gladly have kept his discovery to himself; but a neck like a
sycamore and a thorax capable of containing nine-hours-contest
lungs cannot be hid when Academy time comes
round. Sopley's measure was known. If Sopley painted
an heroic picture it was certain he had had a hero as model.
The Academy opens in May; before June was out Sopley's
find was no longer his own. Sir Frederick Henson, the
artist who moved so in the world that in him the tradition of
the monarch who picked up the painter's brush for him
might almost have been said to live again, saw Buck,
marked Buck down as his own, and presently had sole possession
of Buck.</p>

<p>The Honourable Emily Scarisbrick already had possession
of Sir Frederick. To be sure, it neither needed a Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Frederick Henson to teach her the stippling of birds' eggs
and the copying of castles for the albums of her friends, nor
was the great Academician accustomed to stooping to the
office of salaried drawing-master; but&mdash;the Honourable
Emily was a Scarisbrick, of Mallard Bois.</p>

<p>In Henson's studio the Honourable Emily first saw Buck
Causton.</p>

<p>To say that she fell in love with him would demand a
definition of the term. Certainly she fell in something
with him. Perhaps that something was the something that
at the last thrusts baronies and Mallard Boises aside as hindrances
to a design even larger than that in which they play
so important a part; but we have nothing to do with large
designs here. Call it what you will: something proper
enough to legend, but of little enough propriety in a modern
lady's life; a feeble echo of Romance, perhaps, but never
itself to become Romance unless, of it or present scandal,
it should prove the stronger. At any rate, it was a very
different thing from anything she felt, or ever had felt, for
Captain Cecil Chaffinger, of the White Hussars, her brother's
nominee for her hand.</p>

<p>It was a word dropped by the gallant Captain, himself a
follower of the fancy, that led her to the discovery that the
hero of some feat or other of extraordinary skill and endurance,
and the young Ajax, all chest and grey eyes and
brown curls, who did odd jobs about the studio in the intervals
of posing for Henson's demigodlike canvases, were one
and the same person. Her already throbbing pulse
bounded. She herself was twenty-eight, a small, dark, febrile
woman, given over to discontents based on nothing
save on an irremediably spoiled childhood, and perhaps
hankering after an indiscretion in the conviction that indiscretions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
were of two kinds&mdash;indiscretions, and the indiscretions
of the Scarisbricks. Naturally she became conscious
of a quickened interest in her art.</p>

<p>The first indication that this interest passed beyond birds
eggs and castles was that she began "Lessons in Drapery."
If here for a few moments her story becomes a little technical,
it may be none the less interesting on that account.</p>

<p>The study of Drapery <i>as</i> Drapery has not much interest
for anybody unless perhaps for a student of mechanics.
For all that, it is, or then was, regarded by drawing-masters
as a self-contained subject, to be tackled, ticked off, and
thenceforward possessed. To the study of Drapery in this
unrelated sense the Honourable Emily apparently inclined.
Seeing her therefore, in this fundamental error, Sir Frederick,
a master of Drapery, took from her the "copies"
which had already supplanted the "copies" of castles in
her portfolio, and good-humouredly began to tell her what
she really wanted. What she really wanted, he said, was to
rid her mind of the idea that folds existed for their own
sake, and to endeavour to realise that their real significance
lay in the thing enfolded. Miss Scarisbrick thanked him.</p>

<p>So, at first from the lay figure, and then from Henson's
model, she began to draw Drapery with special reference to
the thing draped.</p>

<p>About this time she gave Captain Chaffinger for an answer
a "No" which he refused to take. His devotion, he
said, forbade him. If by his devotion he meant his devotion
to his creditors, his constancy remained at their service.
In the meantime he was still able to pay his old debts by
contracting new ones.</p>

<p>The Honourable Emily's studies became diligent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>There is little to be said about these things except that
they do happen. A word now about Buck's attitude.</p>

<p>Had the Honourable Emily's maid thrown herself at his
head he would have known what to do. His sense of the
holiness of social degrees would have received no shock.
But the Honourable Emily, who could command her maid,
could not command what in all probability her maid would
not have had to ask twice for. The most she got (when
after much that is omitted here, it did at last dawn on the
bashful Buck that she had any will in the matter at all) was
a blush so sudden and violent that it compelled an embarrassed
reddening of her own cheeks also. Buck was not
personally outraged. It was his sense of Order that was
outraged. He remembered the lady's station for her, and,
stammeringly but reverentially, put her back into it.</p>

<p>Now to be merely reverential to a woman who is in love
with you is to provoke impatience, anger and tears. On
the other hand, to see a woman in tears because you will
not permit her to humiliate herself is to have the other half
of an impossible situation. It was one luncheon-time (the
Honourable Emily now lunched frequently at the studio)
that the tears came.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't care for me&mdash;you don't care for me!"
she sobbed.</p>

<p>Buck could not truthfully have said that he did care
for her; but there she was before him, in tears.</p>

<p>"If it were that Dragon girl, now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Buck, while not failing to see the force of this, could
only make imploring movements for the Honourable Emily
to calm herself. Presently she did calm herself, sufficiently
to change her tone to one of irony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you read your Bible?" she shot over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," said Buck&mdash;"that is&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The reason for Buck's hesitation was that he had suddenly
doubted whether the Honourable Emily would know
a Racing Calendar by the name she had just used.</p>

<p>"Do you mean <i>The</i> Bible, miss?" he said, fidgeting.</p>

<p>She snapped: "Yes&mdash;the one with the story of Joseph
in it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She burst into tears anew.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I should have to beg a man to marry me! I
hate myself&mdash;I hate you!"</p>

<p>Her hatred, however, did not prevent repetitions of the
scene. At the last repetition that need trouble us here her
tears conquered. The helpless Buck comforted her after
the only fashion he knew anything about&mdash;the fashion he
would have used towards her maid&mdash;on his knee.</p>

<p>He still, however, called her "Miss."</p>

<p>They were privately married in the June of 1869.</p>

<p class="p2">"<i>Don't</i> call me 'Miss'!" she broke out petulantly one
day in the middle of the honeymoon. "And you are <i>not</i>
to have your meals with the servants! I shall lunch in
my room to-day, and you are to be ready to take me out at
three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes, m'm," said Buck.</p>

<p class="p2">Probably Lord Moone had less to do than he supposed
with the separation that took place in the September of the
same year. We may assume that a much more potent
factor was the Honourable Mrs. Causton's remembrance of
her own words, "That I should have to beg a man to marry
me! I hate myself&mdash;I hate you!" She did very soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
hate both herself and him. Poor Buck merely hated the
whole subversive anomaly.</p>

<p>He accepted the proposal that they should separate with
perfect docility. It seemed to him entirely right. Indeed
the only thing he had not accepted with docility had been
his introduction to Lord Moone, on the only occasion on
which the two men ever met, as "Mr. Buckley, the drawing-master."
Buck hadn't liked that much. He had
made himself Buck Causton in nine hours of terrific combat,
and as Buck Causton he preferred to be known. But
all else he suffered with touching obedience, and at the
proposal that they should go their several ways his finger
flew to his forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," he said; and his heart, if not his lips, murmured
the prayer that begins: "God bless the Squire and
his relations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They parted.</p>

<p>They only met once more. This was in the January of
the following year, in the great antlered hall at Mallard
Bois, that was as regularly used on all occasions as if there
had not been salons and galleries and drawing-rooms in a
dozen other parts of the great place. The Honourable
Mrs. Causton lay on a couch drawn up to the fire-dogs; her
husband looked submissively down on her, dwarfing the
suit of armour of Big Hugo by which he stood.</p>

<p>She made a new proposal. It was that he should put
it into her hands to set herself free once for all.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," said Buck.</p>

<p class="p2">"Then," said the Honourable Mrs. Causton a quarter of
an hour later, "there's the question of cruelty."</p>

<p>Buck's thoughts wandered slowly back to the Piker.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, miss," he said.</p>

<p>"I need hardly tell you that as far as&mdash;er&mdash;procedure&mdash;can
be stretched it will be stretched."</p>

<p>"Yes, miss. Thank you, miss."</p>

<p>Then wistfully Buck's eyes wandered from Big Hugo's
suit of armour to his wife's face again.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, about that cruelty, miss," he said
unhappily. "Couldn't I go down&mdash;just for once, Miss&mdash;as
Mr. Buckley?"</p>

<p>"No; but I can assure you that <i>I</i> don't want this talked
about more than must be either. Perhaps I ought to tell
you that I shall probably marry again."</p>

<p>Buck's finger went to his forehead again, this time in a
duty to his successor. Then his eyes grew grave. His
wife had made a slight movement.</p>

<p>"If I might make so bold, miss&mdash;there's another
thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She knew what he meant.</p>

<p>"You've nothing to do with that," she said quickly.</p>

<p>Buck would have thought that he had, but if a lady said
he hadn't, well, he hadn't, that was all.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss.... And asking your pardon again&mdash;about
that cruelty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's over," said Mrs. Causton, closing her eyes.
"Six months ago."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't remember," said Buck; but once more, if
a lady said it was so, so it was. Again the grave look came
into his eyes, and again she understood.</p>

<p>"I can have it looked after better than you can," she
said.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;please&mdash;you will?" he dared to supplicate.</p>

<p>She nodded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>Still he hesitated.</p>

<p>"If it's a little boy, miss&mdash;I might be opening a Sparring
Academy&mdash;strictly for the gentry&mdash;I wouldn't charge
him nothing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And after a little further discussion the shameful piece
of collusion came to an end.</p>

<p>They were divorced in the March of 1870. On the 15th
of April the child was born&mdash;a girl. Fifteen months later
the Honourable Emily married Captain Cecil Chaffinger,
of the White Hussars.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">II</p>

<p>The child never got on well with her mother. Mrs.
Chaffinger never forgave her her paternity. The
gallant Captain, on the other hand, treated her as he would
have treated his own child&mdash;that is to say, he bought her
extravagant toys if the proximity of a toyshop put it into
his head to do so, pinched her arms and cheeks and neck
jocularly whenever he found her head at the level of his
waistcoat, and then departed, as likely as not to pinch
maturer arms and necks, not Mrs. Chaffinger's, elsewhere.
He took his wife's former <i>mésalliance</i> with perfect serenity.
She had paid his debts and enabled him to spend a
day or two in his father's house when he cared to do so, and
the Captain, who was a gentleman and not very much else
to boast of, held faithfully to his part of the bargain. He
even dropped in once or twice at Buck Causton's new
<i>Salle d'Armes</i> in Bruton Street. The child was called by
his name&mdash;Louise Chaffinger; he called her Mops, because
of her quantities of thick brown hair. The Honourable
Emily became querulous and an invalid; took to falling
into dozes no matter who was present, and waking up again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
with alarming cries; and she busied herself with charitable
works performed in an uncharitable temper.</p>

<p>Louie was not pretty; but the jocular Captain pinched
no prettier neck than hers, and he declared, as the child
grew, that her "points" would be best displayed could she
go about in the largest and shadiest hat and the most closely
fitting tights possible. His house (which, by the way, he
had begun to encumber again) was Trant, in Buckinghamshire;
but the child was packed off occasionally, to be rid
of her, to Mallard Bois, Lord Moone's seat, there to romp
with her cousin, Eric Scarisbrick, already preparing for
Eton, and such small fry as climbed trees and cheeked the
gardeners with him. Here she revelled in the liberty that
was denied her at home; and perhaps she already realised
instinctively that her mother's relief at having her out of
the way was tempered only by the invalid's resentment that
the child could be happy out of her own not very cheerful
company. Be that as it may, the girl was told, at twelve
years of age, that she was getting too big to kick these
limbs her stepfather so admired about among growing
boys. She was given half-long skirts and French and English
governesses: the French one, though she did not yet
know it, as a preparation for sending her to a Paris convent.</p>

<p>At fourteen years of age she had not heard of the man
whose grey eyes and perfect shapeliness of body she inherited.
The Scarisbricks, be sure, had allowed that episode
to be hushed up. But the day was bound to come
when she should hear of the Honourable Mrs. Causton and
identify that lady with her mother. The day did come, no
matter how; and, inwardly trembling but outwardly resolved,
she sought her mother. Mrs. Chaffinger had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
come with a cry out of a doze. Her daughter demanded to
be told who the Honourable Mrs. Causton was. She was
told that there was no such person.</p>

<p>"Then who was she?" the girl demanded. There were
few of her questions to her mother that were not demands.</p>

<p>"Who's been telling you about her?"</p>

<p>That did not seem to Louie to matter. She repeated the
question.</p>

<p>"She was a very great fool," Mrs. Chaffinger snapped.
"Why aren't you with Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Who was she besides being a very great fool?" the
child persisted.</p>

<p>It had to come out.</p>

<p>"Then papa <i>isn't</i> my father?" Louie said, pale. All
through her life she was pale in her moments of stress.</p>

<p>"I'm your mother, and I tell you to go to your French
lesson at once."</p>

<p>But Louie did not move.</p>

<p>"Then who was my father?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose he is, when I was Mrs. Causton?"</p>

<p>"Is?... Then he isn't dead?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffinger compressed her lips.</p>

<p>"I was going to tell you all about Mr. Causton all in
good time" (her daughter looked coldly unbelieving),
"but since you are here I'll tell you now. Sit down on
that chair and stop fidgeting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she told the girl the facts, not to be denied, of the
divorcing of Buck.</p>

<p>The end of the matter was that Louie now hated, not
only her mother, but her father also.</p>

<p>Her stepfather she thenceforward addressed as "Chaff."
He liked it.

<p>Three months later she was sent to Paris.</p>

<p>Eight months later still she turned up again, not at
Trant, but at the Captain's club in London. She announced
that she had run away from the convent and did
not intend to return to it. Her arrival, though not unwelcome,
was inopportune, for the Captain had a little
party that evening and seemed disconcerted. The toyshops,
he reflected, were closed, and then he looked at his
stepdaughter again.... It could not, after all, have been
one of the more characteristic of the Captain's parties, for
he took Louie to it, pigtail and all, and for a whole evening
pinched nobody. Then he took her to his chambers,
winked at his man in token of something extraordinary,
hesitated, and then, with an "Oh, be hanged to it!" expression,
gave Louie the key of his own sleeping apartment.
Louie examined his prints a little wonderingly, but
approved of his ribboned haircurlers and large frilled pincushion,
and then went to sleep. The next day the Captain
took her down to Trant and left her there.</p>

<p>The next few years were a constant succession of
wrangles with her mother. She had flatly refused to return
to the convent, and if the Honourable Emily was
petulant, her daughter was merciless. She had been put
off with the drawing-master version of her mother's marriage,
but that was enough; she held it over her mother's
head, and Buck, if he had desired revenge, had it. She
knew herself to be hybrid, and treated the Scarisbricks
and their drawing-masters with equal scorn. Worse, she
treated them equally with a contemptuous tolerance. She
harped with pride on the baser strain. In a word, there
was no doing anything with her.</p>

<p>She reached the age of twenty-one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>At twenty-two she expressed a wish to go on the stage.
The Captain, who was genuinely fond of her, stopped that.
At twenty-three she declared plainly that "a girl in her
position" ought to have a means of earning her own living&mdash;not
necessarily drawing. The Captain being averse
from this also, she took the matter into her own hands by
writing to the secretary of a Horticultural College in
Somersetshire, paying her fees, and enrolling herself as a
student without saying a word to anybody. She packed
her boxes, and in the second week of January 1894 presented
herself before her mother, dressed for travelling,
and announced that she had very little time in which to
catch her train.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," she said, turning at the door, "if
you write, you might address letters to me in my own name&mdash;Causton."</p>

<p>Then she left.</p>

<p class="p2">"<i>Was die Mutter träumt, das vollbringt die Tochter.</i>"
Here, with its repetitions of and its departures from that
of the Honourable Emily, follows her story.</p>

<h2 class="p6">PART I<br />
RAINHAM PARVA</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>
<p class="center b1"><b>I</b></p>

<p>The Horticultural College at Rainham Parva, now
defunct, was hardly a college in the modern sense at
all. Its technical books were antiquated; it had only one
or two old microscopes; and it totally lacked the newer
trimmings of specialisation. Its founder, a Bristol seedsman
called Chesson, had bought the place cheaply, house
and all, a dozen years before, and having five hardy daughters
eating their heads off at home, had, as the saying is,
economically emancipated them. That meant then (whatever
it may mean now) that, realising that the wages of two
men and a boy might be saved, he had had them down to
Rainham Parva and had set them to work.</p>

<p>The second Miss Chesson, Miss Harriet, had shown a
real aptitude for the work. She had won, after three years,
a Diploma, and this Diploma, together with the presence in
the house as paying boarder of a niece of Chesson's, had
put an idea into the seedsman's head&mdash;the premium idea.
With the Diploma properly advertised, its grantee made
Principal, a premium or so forgone (called a Scholarship)
and the proper person installed over all as Lady-in-Charge,
Chesson had foreseen a good deal of his work being done
by young women who would pay for the privilege of being
allowed to do it. There is no need to describe the development
of the idea. The enterprise had prospered, and
when Louie Causton had put her name down on the books
and paid her fees the complement of thirty girls was full.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>She did not, after all, travel down alone. Her stepfather,
hinting that it was not necessary to say anything
about this to her mother, made the journey with her. The
pair of them shortened the hours by guessing which of the
young women in the same train were to be Louie's fellow-students;
and when they alighted at Rainham Magna station
the Captain put Louie and her traps into one of the
nondescript vehicles that only saw the light when the Rainham
girls arrived or departed, and drove off with her to the
college. There he shook hands with the Lady-in-Charge,
Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, and asked her whether she was related
to Lovenant-Smith of the 24th. Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's
reply did not actually affirm her regret that she
was so related, but the Captain's affability dried up suddenly.
He was returning to town by the four-o'clock
train; before doing so he took a turn round the place with
Louie.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, as Louie took her leave of him at the
gates, "it's a good growing country, I should say; rum
idea of yours though.... You've heard me speak of
Lovenant-Smith, haven't you? Adjutant eight or nine
years ago; not a bad chap at all, <i>I</i> should have said. She'll
be one of the Shropshire lot, I expect. I knew he had people
down there.... Well, mind you don't run away with
a gardener. 'Bye, Mops&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he was off, tugging at his moustache and inwardly
commenting that the whole escapade was "just like
Louie."</p>

<p>It was a good growing country. Chesson said that the
mildness of the winters was due to the Gulf Stream; Miss
Harriet Chesson attributed it to ozone&mdash;ozone having been
a word to conjure with at the time when she had taken her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Diploma. Ozone or Gulf Stream, it provided wild violets
in December, lemon-verbena that grew in trees up the sides
of the cottages and had to be cut away from the upper
windows, and filled the deep lanes with the hart's-tongue
fern. It also brought forth rich produce. The dairy business
and poultry farm flourished; crates and parcels and
returned empties kept the goods clerk at Rainham Magna
station busy; and, when the heather bloomed on the hill
that rose between Chesson's and the sea, the "Rainham
Heather Honey," green as bronze and thick as glue, was at
a premium. At the crest of the hill the seedsman's estate
ended. Beyond that, dropping abruptly to the west, lay
deep wooded coombes, green to the very rocks of the shore.</p>

<p>Louie's age put her at once out of the class of the "new
girl" who, in the school tales, sits pathetically on her box
and waits for somebody to speak to her. She was twenty-four,
and probably only one other student, the copper-haired
girl with the long thin neck and the "salt-cellars"
showing through her white flannel blouse, who asked her
her number and offered to show her the way to her cubicle,
was more than twenty-two. Her large black feathered
hat (see the first part of the Captain's advice as to how
she would make the most of herself), and her expensively
simple navy blue coat and skirt down to her toes, further
distinguished her among the tweed jackets and ankle-length
skirts of the younger girls. No doubt she had her perfect
management of these and her numerous other garments
from her mother's former interest in the study of Drapery.
If the Captain did not think her face pretty, it must be
remembered that the Captain had standards of prettiness
of his own. Pretty in the professional-beauty sense her
irregular mouth and long chin perhaps were not. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
large, clear, pebble-grey eyes at any rate were arresting.</p>

<p>The copper-haired girl, having shown Louie her cubicle,
offered to show her the rest of the house also. They began
upstairs on the first floor, where the girls slept. The
place was an old mansion in the form of a hollow square,
and as they came to each latticed embrasure Louie stopped
to look at the famous Rainham yew that almost filled the
grassgrown inner courtyard. The corridors were dark,
and sudden steps where no steps were to have been expected
made of the uneven floors a series of booby-traps for those
not familiar with them. Memories of the Monmouth Rebellion
seemed to linger round the corners and to be shut
up in the cupboards of the place. They passed downstairs.
Through the doorway of the handsome Restoration façade
they saw the yew again, dark beyond the shining flags of the
hall. Louie had already been in the reception-room and
Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's private apartments on the right of
the doorway; on the left, she was told, were the quarters of
Miss Harriet (who alone of Chesson's daughters remained
there) and the staff. The domestics slept at the top of the
house; the four male gardeners (all married) occupied the
farm a furlong away at the back.</p>

<p>"But wouldn't you like some tea?" said the copper-haired
girl. "It's in the dining-room."</p>

<p>"I was told to report myself to Miss Chesson at five,"
said Louie, looking at her watch.</p>

<p>"Well, you've just time, if you're quick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They sought the room where the housekeeper ran cups of
tea from the tap of a large and funereal bronze urn.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes to five when Louie entered the dining-room.
Before the clock had struck five she had taken
a certain position in the college.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>She herself hardly knew how it happened. The room
was full of noise and chatter, and near Louie, talking
louder and making more noise than anybody else, was a
lanky child of sixteen, to be a tall blonde beauty in another
three or four years' time, but so far only a mass of
unadjusted proportions and movements that lacked co-ordination.
She had several distinct voices, and in one of
these she was now engaged in unabashed mimicry. Louie,
who had got her cup of tea, heard a bell-like "<i>Os</i>-trich
feathers!" and she was about to put a question to the
copper-haired girl when, with a mock reverence and an explosive
"Your <i>Ma</i>-jesty!" the child swept backwards into
her. She barely saved her cup of tea. The girl gave a
quick turn; her Clum&mdash;" was changed to a "Sorry!"
as she saw a new face, and Louie smiled.</p>

<p>"Your feet were all wrong," Louie said.</p>

<p>The blonde child turned eagerly again.</p>

<p>"Can you do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>The next moment, before Louie could get out "A drawing-room
curtsy? Yes," the child had cried: "Girls!
Girls! Here's somebody who knows how to do it! Do
come and show us!"</p>

<p>"Really?" said Louie, smiling, and handing her cup of
tea to the copper-haired girl.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;come here, Rhoda, and watch (that's my sister&mdash;she's
to be presented, you know)."</p>

<p>Louie laughed. "Quickly then&mdash;I have to see Miss
Chesson&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, pushed unceremoniously forward, and still in her
feathered hat and navy blue costume, Louie made her
first bow to her fellow-students at Chesson's in the deep
and swanlike genuflexion she had practised with her cousin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Cynthia Scarisbrick, a couple of years before. Then she
ran out, smiling.</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> ripping!" she heard somebody say as she did so.
"I expect she's been presented."</p>

<p>Louie sought Miss Harriet.</p>

<p>The Principal, a businesslike, damson-complexioned
woman of forty-five, with a deerstalker hat on her close-cropped
curly hair, asked her what course of study she
proposed to take. Louie replied (in other words) that all
courses were the same to her. Miss Harriet had had that
kind of student before. She asked a few further questions,
and then put Louie down for the elementary course.
She dismissed her with a marked syllabus and a copy of the
Rules.</p>

<p>Louie read the Rules, nodded, as much as to say, "I
thought so!" and then laughed. There was no need to
ask who had drawn them up; she remembered the frigid
way in which Chaff had been put into his place that afternoon.
There was a serenity about them that transcended
the ordinary imperative mood. "<i>Students do not absent
themselves from Morning Prayers or Divine Service without
Permission.</i>" "<i>Students do not give Orders to the
Gardeners or Domestics.</i>" "<i>Students do not pass beyond
the Bounds of the College (Map appended).</i>" If on occasion
students did all of these things, that did not detract
from the <i>largior ether</i> in which the Rules were conceived.</p>

<p>Nor did mere evidence to the contrary ever in the least
degree abate Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's persuasion that the
young ladies of Chesson's, being the daughters of gentlefolk,
were by that very fact almost to be trusted to do without
Rules at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning Louie, with leggings of doe-skin
buttoned to her knees (see the second of the Captain's
recommendations for the attire that suited her best), and
wearing a wide-pocketed jacket not unlike a man's, began
the practical study of Horticulture.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">II</p>

<p>She was attached to the "posse" of six girls of which
the copper-haired student, whose name was Richenda
Earle, was the head. This girl, as the holder of the
scholarship mentioned a page or two back, was the single
non-fee-paying student in the place. Her father was a
bookseller in Westbourne Grove, and she had kept his
books for him before coming to Chesson's. She had
picked up her knowledge of book-keeping at an obscure and
ill-appointed Business School in Holborn, but, her health
being anything but robust, she had taken up gardening under
the impression that it was an out-of-doors pursuit. It
was only this at Chesson's to a strictly limited extent.
Whatever students did or did not learn, the output for the
market had to be maintained, and this necessitated, for
days and days together, work in the twelve long glass-houses,
from the humid heat of which the girls came out
limp and listless and relaxed. Richenda Earle suffered
from these depressions more than most of them, and now
only remained at the college because Miss Harriet had held
out hopes for her of a place on the staff. She was easily
head of all the classes of which she was a member, but
was hopelessly incapable of making her personality felt.
Add to all this that she was avid of popularity, and that
her self-consciousness took the form of making her more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
assertive (without being a bit more effective) than any
girl in the college, and you will see why Louie felt a little
sorry for her without taking to her very much. She for
her part had fastened herself on Louie from the start, and
had been the first to put the question that Louie had had
to answer a dozen times before she had been at Chesson's
two hours.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't been presented," Louie had said, finding
herself waylaid almost at the door of Miss Harriet's room
as she had come out again. "My cousin has; that's where
I learned it. We practised it together."</p>

<p>"I've seen them go in," Richenda had murmured, a
little wistfully, a little dully; "the carriages and things,
you know. I live in London."</p>

<p>Thereupon she had volunteered some of the information
stated above, as if inviting a confidence in return.
"I'm glad you're in my posse," she had concluded, as
Louie had turned away without giving any information
whatever about herself.</p>

<p>The remaining members of "Earle's posse" were the
two Burnett sisters ("B Major," the girl who was to be
presented, and "B Minor," the sixteen-year-old beauty-to-be),
a Scotch girl called Macfarlane, and one other girl,
half French, Beatrice Pigou. There were four other
posses at the college, and each was told off each day to
put itself under the direction of one or other of the four
gardeners, to pot, "prick out," water or whatever the task
might be. The gardener at present in charge of Louie's
posse was a sullen young Apollo called Priddy, whose face
and neck and forearms ozone or the Gulf Stream had
turned to the hue of some deep and old and mellow violin;
and Burnett Minor and the younger girls, talking in terms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of the life to which their eyes were yet sealed, discussed
Priddy with a freedom perfectly innocent and entirely appalling.</p>

<p>Louie had not been at Rainham Parva two days before
she was wondering whether after all she wanted to stay.
She didn't know really why she had come. Not one of the
three commonest reasons for girls being there&mdash;a stepmother,
to be able to earn a little pocket-money, or to get
over a youthful love-affair&mdash;quite fitted her case. And
then there were those ridiculous Rules. She supposed that
if she stayed she would be on the same footing as the
juniors, and she hardly thought she could submit to that.
Not that the Rules did not seem to justify themselves;
on the contrary, they did. Merely because Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
affirmed that students did not do this or that, students
as a matter of fact either did not do these things, or
else consented to class themselves as transgressors when they
did.</p>

<p>But Louie's own attitude in the face of a prohibited
thing, inherited from her mother and now made inveterate
by her upbringing, was invariably that of a wonder
what would happen were the prohibition to be disregarded.</p>

<p>It was just a wonder, nothing more.</p>

<p>Then, on the night of her third day at Chesson's, she
made up her mind to forfeit her fees and leave in the morning.
The reason for her decision was this:</p>

<p>During the vacation certain digging had been allowed by
the gardeners to fall into arrears; and Earle's posse, together
with another set of six girls, had been set to do it.
Now digging was the hardest work the girls were ever
called upon to do, and at the beginning of the term at any
rate they were spared it as much as possible. But education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
or output required that this digging should be done,
and accordingly the twelve girls had digged for the whole
morning, and in the afternoon had varied the labour by
carrying heavy pots from House No. 6 to House No. 10&mdash;a
distance of perhaps sixty yards. The next morning
twelve girls (or rather eleven, for Burnett Minor's unset
muscles had suffered but little) were half incapacitated by
stiffness, and that night there was an outcry for hot baths
and arnica. Louie, clad in dressing-gown and slippers and
carrying her soap and sponge and towel, hobbled to the
bathrooms, and came, in the box-room, upon an indignation-meeting.</p>

<p>This box-room was the common meeting-ground for students
who awaited their turns at the baths. It lay over the
back courtyard arch, and the four bathrooms adjoined it,
two on either side. It was piled almost to the ceiling with
trunks and boxes and dress-baskets, the white initials of
which glimmered in the shadows cast by a couple of candles
on the floor; but there were isolated boxes enough to make
seats for the seven or eight girls already assembled there.
They had slippers on their naked feet and single garments
on their aching bodies; and on one of Louie's own boxes
Burnett Major was peering at the little blue flame of a
spirit-kettle and mixing in a row of cups the paste for that
beverage of revolt&mdash;cocoa. Burnett Minor had traitorously
turned the general righteous anger to private account,
had "bagged" the hottest bath, and was now carolling at
the top of her lungs in the right-hand bathroom.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;then if Earle won't do it I vote we draw lots!"
Macfarlane was exclaiming shrilly as Louie opened the
door. "Those lazy louts of gardeners are supposed to
have all the digging done before we come up&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>They were not&mdash;not if Chesson knew it; but "Of course
they are!" cried five voices at once.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm just not going to stand it&mdash;there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I'm not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And for two pins I'd tell Priddy so!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, but only because, all having
spoken at once, all had to take breath at once.</p>

<p>"It's abominable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Disgusting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Celà m'embête&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here's Causton&mdash;what do <i>you</i> vote, Causton?" they
cried, turning to her.</p>

<p>"What about?" Louie asked.</p>

<p>"Why, everything, of course&mdash;this beastly place&mdash;and
setting us to dig the first week&mdash;and Priddy's beastly
cheek&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then every tongue was unloosed.</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> a row every time we want an extra blouse
washed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> washing two guineas a term extra&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> only the vuggles for dinner that aren't good
enough for the market&mdash;&mdash;" ("Vuggles" were vegetables.)</p>

<p>Another pause for breath.</p>

<p>"Let's what-d'-you-call-it&mdash;strike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie laughed as she sat stiffly down by Burnett Major.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll vote for anything you like; I don't care,"
she said.</p>

<p>Then they began anew.</p>

<p>"Earle's head of the posse&mdash;<i>she</i> ought to do it&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>Richenda Earle's voice broke in in loud complaint.</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> I? You know I would like a shot if it
wasn't for my scholarship. But I should just be told that
if I didn't like it I could go. Elwell's head of your lot.
Elwell ought to go."</p>

<p>"I don't care who goes, but I will <i>not</i> be told to do
things by Priddy."</p>

<p>"Priddy!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>(Louie smiled again as there came from the bathroom
the joyful voice:</p>

<p>"<i>Early one mo-o-orning&mdash;as the su-un was a-rising!</i>&mdash;&mdash;")</p>

<p>"And those pots hadn't got to be moved&mdash;he was only
making work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;gros tyran!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;like they kept us three weeks grading and packing
tomatoes last autumn, and called it 'study'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and the bruised ones for us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;not even fit for ketchup&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Dothegirls Hall <i>this</i> establishment ought to be
called!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another momentary pause: then:</p>

<p>"&mdash;let's all sign a petition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;no, a what-d'you-call-it&mdash;an ultimatum&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;just telling them straight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your bath, Earle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>From the bathroom had come the gurgle of escaping
water. Boiled pink, turbaned with her towel, smelling of
somebody else's scented soap and radiating unrepentance
that Earle's bath must be a tepid one, Burnett Minor
bounced in.</p>

<p>"Friends, Romans, countrymen, do lend me a dry towel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
just to finish with. Oh, Causton, the curtsy, now that I've
something loose on! Crocks! My cocoa, Major, and who
said Priddy just now? 'Students do not fall in love with
Priddy.' (I sha'n't hush.) Sugar, Mac, and, Causton, I
wish you'd do my hair your way, just to see how it
looks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, twirling twice in the midst of a corolla of pink
cashmere dressing-gown, she sank to the floor and began to
nurse a chilblain on her heel.</p>

<p>Louie, her hands behind her head, leaned back and
watched the scene with the greatest amusement. A master-rebel
herself, she knew that here was no rebellion. The
meeting, like other meetings, was merely letting off steam,
and the girls who "wouldn't stand it" would be standing it
exactly the same on the morrow. Well, on the morrow she
herself would be off. Her boxes were only half unpacked;
half-an-hour would put the other things back again. Already
she saw that this Chesson's was an imposition. In
the meantime, the indignation meeting was very amusing.
She felt almost motherly towards these tractable revolutionaries.
Her indulgence became still greater as they spoke
out again.</p>

<p>"Another thing," a girl of Elwell's posse demanded;
"why couldn't I go to Rainham yesterday to have my
photograph taken?"</p>

<p>("Break the camera," Burnett Minor murmured to the
chilblain.)</p>

<p>"And just because somebody'd bagged my boots and I
was five minutes late the other day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Je m'en fiche pas mal&mdash;&mdash;" Pigou began.</p>

<p>("Parly Angly, voo affectay feele," from Burnett
Minor.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to see one of the gardeners at home looking
at us the way Priddy does&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or Miss Harriet either for that matter&mdash;she's only a
sort of forewoman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;applewoman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;tomatoes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;that's all she is really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;nothing else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie laughed outright. Another gurgle had come from
the bathroom, and Earle reappeared. Her announcement
that the water was now cold added to the general sense of
wrong.</p>

<p>"Not even enough hot water!"</p>

<p>"Scarcely a drop, ever!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Odious!"</p>

<p>"Then will somebody come into my cubicle and rub me&mdash;not
you, B Minor."</p>

<p>("Just give a squint out of the window, Elwell.")</p>

<p>("It's all right. Her lights are out. Lovey's too.")</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>won't</i> have a cold bath, to please Lovey or anybody
else!"</p>

<p>Nor did Louie want one. She had risen. She moved to
the window that looked out over the courtyard yew&mdash;the
window from which watch was kept to see when Miss Harriet
and Mrs. Lovenant-Smith retired&mdash;and yawned. In
the middle of her yawn she suddenly laughed again.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she thought. It was too amusing.</p>

<p>Suddenly Richenda Earle, who also was standing by the
window, spoke to her. Evidently Richenda did not think
she had been fairly treated by the meeting.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> think they ought to ask me to?" she complained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Louie turned.</p>

<p>"To ask you to what?"</p>

<p>"To complain to Miss Harriet&mdash;me, the only Scholarship girl."</p>

<p>Louie shrugged her shoulders disdainfully. "Oh, they
won't complain to Miss Harriet!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but one doesn't like to refuse things&mdash;&mdash;" Earle
said in injured tones.</p>

<p>Before Louie would have had time to reply to this, had
she thought of replying to it, a diversion occurred. Nobody
had heard steps approaching, but all at once the door
opened, and Authority, in the person, not of Miss Harriet,
but of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith herself, stood looking in. The
hubbub ceased as the boiling of a kettle ceases when cold
water is poured in. Several of the conspirators rose to
their feet; Burnett Minor, making no bones about it, bolted
behind a box. Great is even the look of Authority; it was
almost a superfluity when Mrs. Lovenant-Smith asked in
measured tones from the doorway: "What is the meaning
of this?"</p>

<p>Already the tails of two dressing-gowns had vanished out
of the other door.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
asked again.</p>

<p>Then she looked round to see on whom to fasten her displeasure.</p>

<p>Louie saw her look, and instantly fathomed its purpose.
She and Richenda Earle stood by the window, as it were the
dramatic centre of some Rembrandtesque composition to
which all else was merely contributory. The Scholarship
girl was going to get into a row. She, Louie, had lived for
years among rows; and was leaving anyway on the morrow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Before the "Miss Earle" had passed Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's
lips Louie had stepped forward.</p>

<p>"We've been waiting for our baths," she said.</p>

<p>Perhaps already Mrs. Lovenant-Smith would have preferred
Richenda Earle to Louie; there is expediency even
in Authority; but the challenge, if it was that, was a public
one. Mrs. Lovenant-Smith turned to Louie.</p>

<p>"Do you know what time it is?" she asked freezingly.</p>

<p>It pleased Louie to take Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's question
<i>au pied de la lettre</i>.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid my watch is in my cubicle. I could tell
you in a moment," she said.</p>

<p>This the Lady-in-Charge saw fit to ignore. She drew
her own watch from her belt.</p>

<p>"It is ten minutes past eleven," she said. "Students
are not out of bed at ten minutes past eleven. Neither are
candles burning. Miss Earle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But again Louie interposed. After all, it was rough on
the Scholarship girl.</p>

<p>"Miss Earle came in only a moment ago to send us to
bed," she affirmed, without a tremor.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, turning to Louie,
and perhaps feeling herself once more headed off, "you,
Miss Causton, as a new student, are perhaps not yet familiar
with the Rules. Be so good as to come to me at ten
o'clock to-morrow morning and I will explain them to you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lovenant-Smith did not make the discomfited rebels
file out past her. She herself retired with dignity. Students
do not linger in the box-room when it is made known
that they are expected to go to bed at once.</p>

<p>But no sooner had the door closed on Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's
back than the pent-up general breath escaped again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in a fluttering exhalation. In it were awe, delight, homage.</p>

<p>"Oh, Causton!" somebody breathed. "You <i>are</i> a
brick!"</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> she?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it stunning of her?"</p>

<p>"You'd have caught it, Earle!"</p>

<p>"I saw it in her eye!"</p>

<p>"But I say, Causton, you'll get a wigging!"</p>

<p>"She didn't speak to you, you know!"</p>

<p>"You cut in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie felt quite confused, so much did they make of so
little.</p>

<p>"Good gracious," she said, "what are you all talking
about? That's nothing, especially as I was thinking of
leaving in any case to-morrow."</p>

<p>There was consternation in the box-room. Had Rebellion
found its leader only to lose her again immediately?</p>

<p>"Leaving!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I sha'n't leave till after ten o'clock now, you may
be sure," Louie laughed.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, I <i>say</i>!"</p>

<p>The dismayed voices dropped. There was a blank silence.
It was only after half-a-minute that Burnett Minor,
who had issued from cover again, begged: "Don't leave,
Causton."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't leave because of anything like this,"
said Louie, enormously amused at the thought. "The
place is a fraud&mdash;that's why I should leave."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't leave," another girl begged.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see what she says to-morrow."</p>

<p>"She can't be <i>too</i> down on you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not the first time&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Something that can only be described as a pleasant
hardening came into Louie's grey eyes. Her laugh
dropped a note. She looked at the adoring faces.</p>

<p>"That's just what I mean," she said. "If she <i>is</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll stay."</p>

<p>And that also her stepfather would have described as
"just like Louie."</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">III</p>

<p>Punctually at ten o'clock on the morrow Louie
knocked at the door of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's office
or drawing-room&mdash;it was both&mdash;and entered. Mrs.
Lovenant-Smith was writing at an escritoire that was not
big enough to accommodate her elbows, and so supported
her braceleted wrists only. There was something contradictory
about her attitude. Its rectitude as she sat at the
inconvenient little desk suggested that she expected Louie,
her turn, pause and inquiring "Well?" that she did not.
Louie's observant eyes had already noticed a curious inconsistency
about the Lady-in-Charge. A great number of
things seemed to lie on the tip of her tongue, ready, apparently
against her own better judgment, to be detached from
it by a perfectly-timed fillip of opposition.</p>

<p>And Louie had only to remember the word or two with
which she had dashed Chaff's affability to be fairly sure
that though cocoa and candles in the box-room at eleven
o'clock at night might seem a good enough reason for the
present interview, as like as not another lay behind it. She
stood just within the door.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Causton?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you told me to come here at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Please to wait a moment."</p>

<p>Louie listened to the squeaking of her quill and the faint
jingling at her wrists as she continued to write.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Lovenant-Smith turned again it was almost
as if she had thought better of something or other&mdash;say of
an encounter with this long-chinned, grey-eyed girl who
stood, not dressed for gardening, but in a long grey morning
frock, looking at her from the door.</p>

<p>"I merely wished to impress on you, Miss Causton, that
the Rules must be observed," she said. "I believe there
is a copy of them on the smaller bureau by your right hand
there. Take it and be so good as to study it. That is all
I wished to say."</p>

<p>Louie did not believe the last sentence, but no disbelief
showed in her eyes. She inclined her head, but watched
Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, waiting for more. She thought that
if she waited more would come. It did. Mrs. Lovenant-Smith,
having just dismissed Louie, rescinded the decision
by speaking again.</p>

<p>"You are older than the others," she said, "and it ought
not to be too much to expect of you that you will set a
good example."</p>

<p>Louie, perhaps gratuitously, read a meaning into the
words. Perhaps you guess what it was. Many of the
older people of her world still remembered her mother's
first marriage, and Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, though Louie did
not like the look of her, was still undeniably of her world.
With Louie herself the drawing-master theory of her paternity
had long since gone by the board; the girl had not
rested until she had discovered that her father was Buck
Causton, pugilist and artists' model, none other; and if Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Lovenant-Smith had ever chanced to hear of her as Louise
Chaffinger, and identified that person under the name which
(whether from pride, spleen, sensitiveness or what not) she
had since reassumed, there would probably be something
very near the tip of her tongue indeed. And just as Buck
had always been a pale fighter, so Louie's own mixed blood,
though it might surge at her heart, left her cheeks untinged
in moments of stress. She still stood, making no motion
to go.</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite follow you," she said slowly.
"Why do you say that something 'ought not to be too much
to expect'?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lovenant-Smith stiffened and drew in again.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to follow me," she said. "You
will find all that is necessary in the Rules. You may keep
that copy; Rule 6 is the one I wish especially to call your
attention to. Would you be so good as to pass me that bell
as you go out&mdash;the small brass one on the cabinet there?"</p>

<p>She half turned to her writing again.</p>

<p>("Good gracious, what next!" thought Louie.)</p>

<p>The bell was a small Dutch figure in a metal farthingale,
and Louie passed it. As she did so she glanced at the hand
that took it. Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's face was wrinkled like
a dried apple, and the hand, though beautifully kept, was
wrinkled too, and had, moreover, rather stumpy nails.
Louie's own hands were exquisite. The bell passed from
hand to hand.</p>

<p>Whether or not it was the glance at the hands, suddenly
the word too much dropped from the tip of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's
tongue. She put the bell down with a little clap.</p>

<p>"The Rules of the college are not called into question,"
she said. "So far they have proved quite sufficient for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the kind of student the college was founded for. By the
way, why are you not dressed for the gardens?"</p>

<p>("'Kind of student'&mdash;good&mdash;gracious!" Louie cried
in astonishment to herself. "Very well, madam&mdash;&mdash;")</p>

<p>She spoke calmly, looking modestly down at her long
cashmere skirt, but taking in her lovely hands (which toyed
with the copy of the Rules) on the way.</p>

<p>"My dress?" she said. "Oh, I wasn't sure whether I
should be staying or not."</p>

<p>Louie knew perfectly well that her leaving would make,
at any rate until her cubicle should be filled again, a difference
of something like sixty pounds a year, with extras, to
Chesson's. That is rather a lot of money to hang upon a
mere breach of Rule 6. Perhaps Mrs. Lovenant-Smith betrayed
herself in the quickness with which she took her up.</p>

<p>"Do you mean you're thinking of leaving?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Louie, who had lifted her eyes for a moment, dropped
them demurely again.</p>

<p>"I mean," she replied, "that I didn't know whether <i>you</i>
were going to dismiss <i>me</i> or not. You see, you may not
want my&mdash;kind of student. I'd rather not be in any way
considered as an exception," she added.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Lovenant-Smith known Louie better she would
have known that she had now no intention whatever of
leaving. As it was, there probably came into her head the
thought that after all Louie was a Scarisbrick and a niece
of Lord Moone. Ladies-in-charge of horticultural colleges
do not fall foul of the Honourable Emily and Lord Moone.
All at once her severity relaxed&mdash;but she hated Louie
thenceforward that it must be so. She smiled a little, but
the smile had a twitch in it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think we need go quite to that extreme, Miss
Causton," she said. "All the same, I'm afraid the Rules
are necessary."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Louie.</p>

<p>"And so long as that is understood, that is the chief
thing. In regard to candles in particular, in an old place
like this there is always the danger of fire. In fact, I'm
not at all sure that a fire drill ought not to be instituted.
May I add that I quite appreciated the chivalrous way in
which you tried to shield Miss Earle last night? Indeed,
I wanted to say that quite as much as the other. I think
that is all. Good-morning, Miss Causton."</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Louie, stalking out.</p>

<p>As she crossed the Restoration hall, "'Kind of student'&mdash;good
gracious!" she exclaimed again. "To talk to me
as if I were Burnett Minor! 'Kind of student!'&mdash;I wonder
it doesn't occur to her that somebody might have told
me all about Miss Hastings and that gardener four years
ago!&mdash;'Kind of student,' indeed!"</p>

<p>Still without changing her clothes, she walked out past
the orchards, up the hill, and sat looking down over the
coombes to the sea.</p>

<p>Leave Chesson's, now? Oh no, nothing was farther
from her thoughts! She would stay, and why? Not because
she had been treated as a junior, but because she had
been taken, as it were, at her own word. She herself might
be perversely and nonchalantly cynical about her mixed
birth, but she did not intend to allow anybody else&mdash;Mrs.
Lovenant-Smith or anybody&mdash;to show as much as a flicker
of consciousness of it. "Kind of student"!&mdash;Oh no, that
amusement was going to be Louie's own private preserve.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>For it had been her cynical amusement. Approximately,
the mood took her once in five or six months, with or without
occasion. Her mother knew its times and seasons, and
its passings into abeyance, not into extinction. She did not
call her sensitiveness morbid; quite on the contrary, she
saw to it that it took the form of a pose of gaiety; she could
be pitilessly gay with herself. Meek, harmless Cynthia
Scarisbrick, for example, could have told tales about her
gaiety when, not knowing whether she herself was eligible
for presentation or not (but gathering from the tense silence
on the subject that had reigned at Trant that she was
not, or at any rate that her mother did not wish it), she had
practised the ceremonial curtsy with her cousin. It had
been Cynthia, not Louie, who had shed the tears.</p>

<p>But to be agreed with by Mrs. Lovenant-Smith that her
origin was open to question (for the Lady-in-Charge had
all but said that)&mdash;oh no, that was really too much!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, who took a seedsman's salary!</p>

<p>She might have known that Mrs. Lovenant-Smith would
know all, all about her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then, as she sat, she began to wonder where she had
heard the name of Lovenant-Smith before. She had wondered
it when first she had received her prospectus at Trant.
Of course her stepfather knew these other Lovenant-Smiths,
the adjutant's lot, and had probably spoken of them, but
she did not think it was that. For a minute or two she
sought in her memory....</p>

<p>She was ceasing to think when the recollection came of
itself. It was only a trifling one after all. One of the
boys with whom she had romped at Mallard Bois&mdash;Roy she
had called him then&mdash;had been, she now remembered, a
Lovenant-Smith. He would be a connection of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
adjutant's. Of course, she had heard the name at Mallard
Bois....</p>

<p>Then Louie bit her lip. If there had been any doubt at
all that Mrs. Lovenant-Smith knew the story of Buck there
was none now. The association with Mallard Bois was
quite enough....</p>

<p>Louie was glad she had looked insolently at those stumpy
hands....</p>

<p>Beast!</p>

<p>The trees below her tossed restlessly, and far out the grey
sea was whitecapped as if it had been rasped with a file.
No boat had put out for the pollock-fishing or to lift a
spiller that morning; only a pilot, a couple of miles out in
the Channel, slowly lifted her nose for a moment and then
hid it again. Louie felt a little cold, and rose. She made
an attractive picture as she did so. Her brown hair was
tossed by the wind, and her long grey skirt cracked behind
her and clipped her limbs almost as if she had worn the
garments of a man.</p>

<p>"Beast!" she muttered again.</p>

<p>Then she thought of another beast&mdash;this father of hers
whose name she had not needed to take but had taken out
of rancour against her mother and despite against herself.
(But not for Mrs. Lovenant-Smith to turn up her nose at!)
He now (she had this from Chaff) kept a public-house
somewhere up the Thames&mdash;Lord Moone's cast-off brother-in-law
in a public-house!&mdash;and any fitful romantic light
that might ever have shone about him was now extinguished.
Of course the Captain had uttered his usual wistful
formula: "Not a bad fellow at all, I should have
said"; but that was rather a criticism on the Captain than
on Buck. Yes. Buck was simply another beast. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
though he were a potman, Mrs. Lovenant-Smith should give
him every bit as much deference as if he had been a brewing
peer....</p>

<p>"And I don't care&mdash;if it <i>is</i> the pride of the cobbler's
dog, I'm going to keep his name," Louie muttered.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned and climbed the stile that led back
to Chesson's land. As she did so she realised that she had
been out of bounds. She laughed curtly. Rule 3! Much
she cared for their Rules! What about the Rule: "Miss
Hastings does not elope with What's-his-Name the gardener"?&mdash;but
that would keep. In the meantime she
would change into her gardening clothes before lunch. She
had shown Mrs. Lovenant-Smith that she had garments of
freedom. The next time Louie threatened to leave she
might be able to add to the force of the threat that she
would take half-a-dozen girls with her.</p>

<p>Well, lunch was in half-an-hour; she had just time to
change.</p>

<p>But as she descended through the orchards again she
came upon Richenda Earle. The copper-haired girl was
washing an espaliered plum-tree, and as she turned her
head Louie saw that she had been crying. She asked Louie
if she was going.</p>

<p>"Leaving here, do you mean? No. What's the matter?"</p>

<p>The girl turned her eyes away.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully for last night," she grunted. "It
was ripping of you. But you see it hasn't made much
difference."</p>

<p>"How, not made much difference?"</p>

<p>Richenda glanced at the tree, and from the tree to the
syringe in her hand and the pail of disinfectant at her feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
"This," she said. "Anybody can do this job, and I've
been sorting out pots over there all the morning," she indicated
the yard behind the trees where the flower-pots and
debris were kept. "And <i>I</i> can't threaten to leave."</p>

<p>"Your scholarship, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I'm supposed to be working for the
medal."</p>

<p>Chesson's wanted a Horticultural Society's medal badly.
They had never had one, nor were likely to get one unless
Richenda Earle got it for them. Louie, who was quickly
fathoming the real economy of the place, looked again at
Richenda's red eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, they won't send you away till you've failed," she
said.</p>

<p>But Earle made an impatient gesture, and her eyes
began to stream again.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's a girl like you know about it!" she broke
out. "Yes, I know they'll keep me till then, but you don't
know anything at all about it! You would if you'd had my
upbringing! You don't know what the struggle is. You
think digging and carrying pots is hard work; you wouldn't
if you'd seen what I've seen! When you go to London it's
just shopping and theatres and suppers and things; but
just you try to keep a small bookseller's accounts for him,
when they're hardly worth keeping, I mean, and collecting
his debts when all his money's tied up in stock and your
father's nearly bankrupt&mdash;not that he's ever solvent&mdash;you'd
know what I meant then!"</p>

<p>Then the unexpected outbreak stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>Louie stood silently staring. She disliked seeing anybody
cry. Richenda's words had little meaning for her;
she supposed they contained a hidden meaning somewhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Then the copper-haired girl went on, more quietly but no
less bitterly:</p>

<p>"I should get a hundred pounds a year on the staff here,"
she said, "that is, if they won't waste me half-days just out
of spite, like they're doing this morning. That's nothing to
you. You others are here just for pocket-money, but we
live on your pocket-money. I suppose I oughtn't to have
come here at all. Not among all you. But I begged father
to let me. Father once apologised to me&mdash;that was when
there was a distraint out against him, if you know what
that is&mdash;because he wasn't rich. Fathers ought all to be
rich, he said. There are seven of us girls at home, and only
one married. Oh, I tell you, you don't know!"</p>

<p>Louie wondered why she preferred Richenda Earle loud
and striving for the popularity she never got to Richenda
Earle unburdening herself thus. She herself went brightly
masked, and disliked to see another's mind naked. Richenda's
mind was stripped now. It was distasteful. Somehow
or other Richenda contrived to miss both the balm of
popularity and the solace of private sympathy.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm awfully sorry," Louie said awkwardly and
a little stiffly.</p>

<p>At the tone Richenda drew in instantly.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," she said, compressing her lips and
beginning to straighten her hair. "I shall just have to
buck up, that's all. But girls of your class don't know anything
about it, so you needn't think you do. There's the
first gong. Come on."</p>

<p>As they passed the dairies a rabble of students raced past
the end of the house on their way to the boot-lockers.
Louie and Richenda entered by the side door. Richenda
plunged at once into the scramble for house-slippers, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Louie, not having put on her garden boots that day, did not
need to change. It was too late now to put on another
dress. She waited by the inner door.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was spied by Burnett Minor. The child
rushed towards her, a book in her hand.</p>

<p>"Are you going, Causton?" she shouted.</p>

<p>There was a loud "Ssssh!" They could be heard from
the dining-room. The girls flocked round Louie, and
hoarse, excited whispers broke out:</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"She's dressed!"</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Did you see her?"</p>

<p>"Does Causton say she's going?"</p>

<p>"Ssssh&mdash;not all at once!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going," said Louie.</p>

<p>Mouths gaped their very widest to make up for the inaudibility
of the cheers.</p>

<p>"Hooray!"</p>

<p>"Is she going?"</p>

<p>"No, she's not going&mdash;hooray!"</p>

<p>Burnett Minor threw her book joyfully into the book-locker.
Ordinarily her reading varied between an adoration
of Tennyson and mocking and dramatic declamations
either from the "Pansy Library," or from its brother-classics,
of which the typical burlesque is "The Blood-stained
Putty-knife, or The Plumber's Revenge." But
this book was her album.</p>

<p>"I saw you come down dressed, and I did want you to
put something in it if you were going," she whispered gleefully;
"but you're not going! Hoo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voiceless mouth gaped wider than them all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>That midday Louie walked demurely up to Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
at the head of the table and apologised for not
yet having changed. From her tone Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
may or may not have inferred that she had spent the hours
since their interview in contrite meditation. She inclined
her head graciously. But Louie, taking her place for grace
between Burnett Minor and Richenda Earle, was murmuring
to herself once more:</p>

<p>"'Class of student,' indeed!... Good gracious
me!..."</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">IV</p>

<p>Louie quickly became the most popular girl in the
college.</p>

<p class="p2">Her studies she pursued very much as who should say:
"I am Louie Causton&mdash;take it or leave it." Neither Miss
Harriet nor the gardeners could ever tell when she was
interested in a lesson; if she learned, she concealed her
processes. Before April was out&mdash;(the intervening time
may be slipped over; the daily work in the gardens and
houses went on as usual, the usual number of crates and
parcels was despatched from Rainham Magna station, and
already the girls were looking forward to June, which was
always a slack month)&mdash;before April was out she could
"slip" and "bud" as deftly as any when she chose; but
few made more mistakes than she, and none accepted
correction with her remarkable nonchalance. Afternoon
"theory" she had begun to cut almost entirely. A slate
hung in the hall, on which students were supposed to write
down where they might be found when they left the immediate
precincts of the college. One day towards the end
of April there appeared on this slate: "Gone to Rainham;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
L. Causton." Then she awaited events with Mrs. Lovenant-Smith.</p>

<p>There were no events.</p>

<p>She sent to Trant for a bicycle.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, as the spring advanced she needed the air.
The glass-houses, with their smell of musk and mould and
heated pipes and cherry-pie all mingled, oppressed her;
the long forcing-house, where for the time being most of
the work for the markets went on, completely took the
starch out of her. She felt as if she was being forced herself.
She hated the sight of the twelve houses; they merely
meant so much ventilation, so much shutting-down for the
evenings, so much watering, so much lassitude for the girls,
so much money in Chesson's pocket. She was glad she had
sent for the bicycle. Somebody else might read thermometers
and close down and sprinkle floors and ply the hissing
hoses. Louie wanted air.</p>

<p>Yet even the outer air was not sharp enough. It is not
an invigorating air in which the lemon-verbena grows in
trees up the cottage walls and scented geranium flourishes
out-of-doors like a common hedge plant. In the sunken
lanes through which she idled on her bicycle the primroses,
twice as big as she had ever seen them, and the cowslips,
great sub-tropical clusters, were already past; and she expected
to see the roses out presently, big as sunflowers.
There was something almost rank in the sweet bursting out
of the land. She thanked goodness that a daisy was a daisy
still, modest and unmagnified. She was not used to hedges
of fuchsia. Nature might have been a little more sparing
of her myrtle too. Louie always dropped from her bicycle
when, coming out of one of the canals of still and scented
air, she saw, across a burnt heath-patch or a clump of hardy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
gorse, a glimpse of the sea. For the sake of a look at the
sea she often walked up the hill behind Chesson's and sat on
the stile she had crossed on the morning after her interview
with Mrs. Lovenant-Smith.</p>

<p>Except by her example, however, she incited nobody else
to break the Rules.</p>

<p>It was curious that she should know herself to be popular,
and yet at the same time should also be secretly aware that
she was a little out of things. All went well enough for the
present, but only for the present. She knew quite well
what would happen did she, a year or two hence, chance to
meet any of her present fellow-pupils. She would not,
then, be older than they in quite the same sense that she
was now. They would meet; there would be eager recollections
of the old days at Chesson's; oh, for that matter she
could make it all up now!... "Come where we can have
a really good talk! Where's Burnett Major now, and her
sister? And have you heard from Elwell lately? And I
wonder what's become of that red-haired girl&mdash;what was
her name&mdash;Earle&mdash;yes, Earle? And of course you know
Macfarlane's going to be married.... Now tell me all
about what you're doing!"... Oh yes, Louie could make
all this up&mdash;the bursts, the pauses, the dead stops, and then
the falsely bright, perfunctory talk about Chesson's again.
For she and her fellow-students would not be doing the same
things. They would have taken recognised places, and
Louie was not sure that she herself had a place to take.
Her father and mother had seen to that. She remained a
spectator. If she was liked now, it was not because she
went one inch out of her way to be so. She was just as
ready to go out of her way to be disliked if she must go
out of it at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, however, here she was at Chesson's, to
all intents and purposes her own mistress, and made so
much of that she had Mrs. Lovenant-Smith largely at her
mercy&mdash;for, had she been requested to leave, the two Burnetts,
Elwell and others would now have left with her. So,
doing exactly as she liked, and adored on every hand, Louie
even wondered sometimes whether she had not been wrong
in supposing that restlessness and discontent were bred in
the very bones of her.</p>

<p>She was at the very top of her popularity about the time
Burnett Major gave the birthday "cocoa" in her cubicle.
(That is to say, Burnett Major gave the nucleus of the
"cocoa"; the rest of the party happened by a natural
process of accretion.) This time the junketing was held
by Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's permission; it had been acceded
readily. "Lovey's not such a bad old sort when you get
used to her," B. Major said. It was in mid-May, on a hot
evening, and, though Burnett's window was flung wide
open, showing the dark yew outside, not a breath stirred,
and the flames of the candles were four inches long in the
air. Besides cocoa, Burnett had provided cake and biscuits
and candied fruits and an enormous box of "assorted"
chocolates; and Burnett's bed was like to break down with
the weight of girls upon it.</p>

<p>Louie had had Burnett Major especially in her mind
when she had painted her fancy picture of a possible meeting
with her fellow-students a year or two hence. The two
sisters were the daughters of a Gloucestershire M.F.H., and
Louie could forgive B. Major for being a little dazzled by
her approaching presentation. There was nothing unfamiliar
to Louie, either, in the rest of the things she felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
herself, at one and the same time, both "in at" and "out
of," for probably Mewley Hall, the Burnetts' home, was
not very different from Trant or Mallard Bois. But Burnett
Major's position a few years hence was a forgone conclusion;
she filled it already in anticipation; and the noisy
talk that was in progress as Louie joined the party threw
bright lights on it.</p>

<p>They were discussing the coming vacations. These were
Chesson's yearly dread. They interrupted his supply of
free labour, and there were always fewest girls when he most
wanted them. As the vacation arrangements rested after
all chiefly with the parents, he could do little except express
his preference that as many of the girls as possible should
take their holidays in the empty month of June, and his
hope that those who did not do so would defer them until
as late as they could. Otherwise he was, to that extent, no
better off than his trade competitors.</p>

<p>"Here she comes," Burnett Minor was crying as Louie
entered the crowded cubicle. "I want to be here when
Causton is. It's all right for Major&mdash;oh, you needn't
think we don't know, Major&mdash;if you aren't actually engaged
he's always about the place when you're at home&mdash;and I'm
going to stalk you both with a camera and then what-d'you-call-it&mdash;blackmail
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Minor, or I shall send you out," B. Major
ordered.</p>

<p>"Then I shall tell everybody who he is and shout his
name through the keyhole. It's&mdash;&mdash;" She moved her
lips, threatening to pronounce the name there and then.</p>

<p>"Sneak!" said her sister.</p>

<p>B. Minor bridled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> tell them if you call me that again! Causton,
have you a young man? (That means, Avez-voo un jeune
homme, Pig?)"</p>

<p>"Not for you to shout his name through keyholes," Louie
replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, but do tell us&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"At my age?" said Louie mockingly, sitting down on
the edge of the bed and reaching for candied fruits.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;you're trying to wriggle out of it&mdash;<i>have</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Hush, little girl&mdash;open your mouth&mdash;&mdash;" She popped
a fruit into the mouth that itself resembled an untouched
fruit.</p>

<p>Pigou, from the lower deck of the washstand, interposed
loudly:</p>

<p>"Elle a vingt-quatr'ans&mdash;elle est perdue!"</p>

<p>"Uppé petite chose, avec voter Françay," commented
Burnett Minor.</p>

<p>"Cau-ston coiffe déjà Sainte Catherine," said the ruthless
Pigou: "à vingt-quatr'ans on est déjà&mdash;pff!"</p>

<p>"Non elle isn't pff&mdash;rude chose! But she'll tell me
when we sleep out, because I'm going to have my mattress
next to hers, sha'n't I, Causton?"</p>

<p>"Mais elle vient d'promettre&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and we shall talk about all those things you always
say 'Hush' when I come in&mdash;sha'n't we, Causton?"</p>

<p>"Prrridd-ee!" taunted the French child: and B. Major
spoke.</p>

<p>"But I say, Causton, when do you take your vac.&mdash;June
or September?"</p>

<p>"And where shall you go?" somebody else demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Ireland&mdash;father's taken a house," cried a
third.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody cares where you're going! Causton, will you
come home with us?"</p>

<p>"No; come to Ireland with us!"</p>

<p>"Well, can I come home with you? I loved that man
who brought you here!" (Burnett Minor was the young
woman who had loved Chaff.)</p>

<p>"It wasn't Lord Moone, was it?" Macfarlane asked.</p>

<p>"Or was it your father?"</p>

<p>"Your cocoa, Causton," said B. Major.</p>

<p>Louie had never been so run after before. She curled up
among the slippered feet at the foot of the bed (there were
four girls stretched upon it), and alternately stroked the
hair and tweaked the ears of Burnett Minor, who had defeated
Pigou in the scramble to put her head into Louie's
lap. "I <i>can</i> have the pitch next to yours, can't I?" the
child demanded, her eyes turned up and her face (to Louie)
upside down. "There, you see, Pig, she says I can&mdash;so
voo juste pouvez sechey-up, là."</p>

<p>This sleeping out was a summer custom at Chesson's. It
began with the warm weather, sometimes in June, sometimes
in July. On account of the morning and evening
carrying of bedding and mattresses, the "pitches" nearest
the house were deemed the most desirable, and weeks
ahead there was bickering about the "bagging" of them.
They bickered now, and then turned to the vacations again.</p>

<p>Louie listened, saying little. For her, vacations in this
sense hardly existed. Vacations lose their value when you
study as slackly as Louie did. It might be amusing to go
home with one or other of the girls for a week or two, but on
the other hand she hardly thought she would. These were
the things she was both "in at" and "out of." B. Major
was talking about them now. Soon she would be taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
her presentation lessons; she was coming out; she had an
unofficial admirer; yes, Louie saw quite plainly what B.
Major's future would be. What was her own going to be?
She had not the least idea.... No, she did not really want
a vacation. More or fewer, there would be girls at Chesson's
throughout the summer. Chesson's still amused her;
she could leave once for all when it ceased to amuse her.
She was learning nothing. She neither wished to start a
lavender farm, as Elwell, the daughter of Sir James Elwell
of the Treasury, did, nor to grow peaches, as did Macfarlane,
nor to add to her pocket-money by selling pot-pourri at
extravagant prices to her friends, which was Burnett Major's
idea&mdash;until she should marry. She could hardly sell
pot-pourri to her prize-fighting father. She might (she
smiled) sell him hops&mdash;she seemed to remember that beer
was made of hops....</p>

<p>And she certainly did not intend to mug at theory for the
sake of a medal, as Earle was doing at this very moment....</p>

<p>The party was still discussing this life which was hers
and yet not hers when Miss Harriet, going her rounds,
tapped at the door and entered.</p>

<p>"Bedtime, young ladies, please," she said. "Mrs.
Lovenant-Smith's compliments, and she hopes you have enjoyed
yourselves."</p>

<p>Her tone was that of one who might say: "You see,
young ladies, what liberty you have <i>within</i> the Rules; isn't
it much pleasanter all round?"</p>

<p>The party broke up.</p>

<p>The weeks passed. In June a number of the girls went
home, Earle among them. Permission to sleep out was
given, a little earlier than usual on account of the heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
mildness of the nights; and Louie lay in the orchard, between
Burnett Minor and little Pigou. The convolvulus
came out, great white trumpets in the hedges; the sea over
the hill became of a milky blue; and there floated out to it
dense tracts of odours, lilies, and syringa, jasmine and roses
and hay. You wearied of the smell of meadow-sweet; in
the houses you could hardly take breath. The sun was reflected
piercingly from their glass roofs, and the girls spent
the afternoons in deck-chairs under the shadow of the courtyard
yew.</p>

<p class="p2">The thing that (Louie sometimes told herself afterwards)
made all the difference and yet (as she also sometimes
told herself) made no difference at all, began very
trivially. It was just such another accident as that which,
nine or ten years before, had sent her to her mother with
a demand to be told "who the Honourable Mrs. Causton
was."</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the girls at Chesson's were a little careless
about the dressing of their hair. You cannot move constantly
among banks of plants, and pick fruit, and net
cherry-trees, and be for ever stooping over beds and frames,
and keep your hair fit to be seen. Therefore, once a month
or so, the girls might, if they wished, go in parties of four
or five to a hairdresser's at Rainham, there to be professionally&mdash;whatever
the word may be. These parties were made
up more with a view to the enjoyment of the half-holiday
than to the business strictly in hand; and Louie, had she
cared, might have been a member of each detachment that
went. On this particular day Louie had had much ado to
free herself from Burnett Minor's affectionate clutch.</p>

<p>"Oh, do come with our lot, Causton!" B. Minor had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
begged. "Oh, you are rotten! You know you went with
Elwell before, and with Major before that, and I do want
mine properly done like yours, not just punched up the
way we do it!"</p>

<p>"What, like Saint Catherine?" Louie laughed.</p>

<p>"Do come."</p>

<p>But Louie had shaken her off.</p>

<p>"He'll remember how mine's done; I was there a week
ago. No, I won't come. I'm going to do some theory this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fib! You never do theory!"</p>

<p>"Well, I ought to. No, I won't come."</p>

<p>"Then will you lend me your bicycle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like; but the others are walking, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll wobble with them."</p>

<p>And Louie had watched the party set out, Burnett Minor
on the bicycle, "wobbling" and leaving behind her a complicated
track in the dust of the drive.</p>

<p>She did not know why she had said she would do theory
that afternoon. She supposed it was because she felt slack
and bored. Nor did she do very much theory. She went
into the classroom, languidly turned over the pages of an
old "Balfour," wondered what it mattered to anybody at
Chesson's (except perhaps to Earle) that "movements had
been observed in the pollen-grains of Cereus Speciosissimus,"
or that "changes took place in the stamens by suppression
and degenerations of various kinds." Then she
glanced at a preparation on the stage of the microscope opposite
Richenda Earle's empty chair, and yawned. She
looked out into the courtyard. Three or four girls dozed
in deck-chairs under the dark yew. There was an empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
chair&mdash;but no; a clatter of washing up was going on in
the kitchen under the box-room; she would go up to her
cubicle.</p>

<p>She did so, and, pushing off her slippers, lay down on
her bed.</p>

<p>Her window was open as far as it would go, but the
yew seemed to shut out even what little air there was. All
that entered was the faint acrid smell of consuming rubbish;
they were slow-burning somewhere at the back. The
sounds of the washing up were fainter now; a pigeon
alighted on her sill. She had been an idiot, she told herself,
to fag herself that morning listening to Hall's demonstration
in the forcing-house. She wished there was a
pond about the place, with a boat or a punt. She would
have bagged the boat to sleep in. It would be jolly to be
rocked to sleep in a boat or a punt.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes. The last thing she saw before she
did so was the little black-framed miniature of the fourth
Lord Moone, the last but three, in his tied wig and ensign's
uniform. Louie had tacked it up by her mirror
merely because it had been in her room at Trant as long
as she could remember and, if one might judge from the
youthful face, he was less of an opinionated fool than the
other Moones&mdash;much less so than Uncle Augustus....</p>

<p>She turned over. Then she slept.</p>

<p>Sleep also was deep, too deep, at Rainham Parva. It
weighed on the girl like a mulch. At five o'clock Louie
could hardly drag herself out of it. She fumbled at her
loosened belt and pulled out her watch. Five! The tea-gong
must have gone.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps tea would rouse her.</p>

<p>She felt by the side of the bed for her slippers, rose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
touched her hair as she passed the glass, and went drowsily
downstairs.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Lovenant-Smith and Miss Harriet always took
tea in their own or one another's rooms&mdash;which, for that
matter, the students also were permitted to do if they chose&mdash;the
meal was a noisier one than either lunch or supper.
Louie heard one of Burnett Minor's several voices as she
pushed at the door. The child saw Louie's face in the
opening and sprang up.</p>

<p>"Here she is&mdash;give it to me&mdash;I'm going to read it myself&mdash;&mdash;"
she cried.</p>

<p>Burnett Minor always wanted to read it herself&mdash;"it"
usually being one of the sublimer passages from the current
number of the "Pansy Library" or an especially
choice one from an office-boys' periodical. Louie smiled
languidly now as the girl snatched a booklet from Elwell's
hand and gave tongue.</p>

<p>"I've punctured your back tyre, Causton, but Mac has
some solution and we'll mend it after tea&mdash;and I'm always
to do my hair like this, Harris says&mdash;do look at it, isn't it
stunning?&mdash;and now&mdash;aha!" (somebody had made a grab
for her book). "Thought you'd got it, didn't you, Elwell?
Now I'll read it first and then show her the picture, and
that reminds me, Mac, you've never given me my 'Jack
Sheppard' back that I lent you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie reached for a chair. She yawned again.</p>

<p>"Do give me a cup of tea, somebody. I hope the watering's
all done, for I'm not going to do any. What's the
child got now? If it's 'Maria Martin' or 'Irene Iddesleigh,'
I think I know them by heart."</p>

<p>The child herself answered her question. She jumped
on a chair and extended an arm for silence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>"Ready?" she cried. "Now!"</p>

<p>"'THE LIFE AND BATTLES OF BUCK CAUSTON,'"</p>

<p>she declaimed in her most ringing voice,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'<i>Being the Full Story and Only Authorised
Life of this Famous Pugilist</i>'&mdash;
</p></div>

<p>("Causton's uncle, don't forget, girls)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'<i>Revised by Himself and now Published for the
First Time&mdash;including his Historic Encounter

</div>

<p>("Piker Betteridge&mdash;'Piker'&mdash;isn't it lovely?)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'<i>Entered at Stationers' Hall and All Rights Reserved</i><br />
<span class="smcap i6">"'Price One Penny</span>'"</p>
</div>

<p>B. Minor drew out every syllable of the linked sweetness,
and concluded;</p>

<p>"And lo and behold&mdash;on the cover&mdash;Buck himself&mdash;Uncle
Buck, Causton&mdash;you needn't say he isn't&mdash;as large as
life and twice as beautiful&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>She held up the booklet in triumph.</p>

<p>But she drew it back again, bubbling with enjoyment.
"Wait till I find <i>the</i> gem&mdash;the one about Piker," she cried.</p>

<p>Her fingers fluttered rapidly through the precious pennyworth
in search of the "gem."</p>

<p>Louie's cup of tea had been at her lips, but not a drop
spilt as she put it down again. If her colour changed at all
it was only as that other pale fighter's had done whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
story, Price One Penny, the unconscious Burnett Minor
was rapturously searching.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" cried B. Minor, peremptorily extending
her hand again. "Listen, everybody!&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'<i>But the redoubtable Buck refused to allow the wiper

and the claret that flowed from his beezer. Game

</p></div>

<p>But Louie had risen and walked to the child. She held
out her hand.</p>

<p>"Let me look," she said.</p>

<p>B. Minor gave her a suspicious look, as if she feared she
might be reft of her treasure. "You will give it me
back?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>Louie took the book.</p>

<p>She supposed she was awake now, but somehow a curious
air of unreality enveiled whatever it was that was happening.
She looked at the cover of the "Life" in her hand.
The most execrable of woodcuts could hardly disguise what
she saw. Traditionally posed, nude above the waist, and
clad below only in tights and fighting-shoes&mdash;formidably
watchful, lightly poised for the blow&mdash;in appearance at
any rate he was a man and superb. But really he had been
cruel, faithless, divorced.</p>

<p>As if she had passed merely from one state of half-wakefulness
to another, she did not think of the bomb she was
about to drop among the girls. She only wanted to look,
and to look, and to look again at this man, who was her
father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it just Causton's mouth and chin?" she barely
heard Burnett Minor bubbling. "But I can't say she has
Uncle Buck's beezer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Slowly Louie handed the "Life and Battles" back. At
any rate she had now seen him, if only in a wretched woodcut.
She looked quietly about her.</p>

<p>"That's my father," she said, perhaps a shade distinctly
and loudly.</p>

<p>Then she looked about her again.</p>

<p>Burnett Minor jumped down from her chair. Her eyes
shone flattery on Louie. The very audacity of such a lie
compelled her admiration.</p>

<p>"O-o-oh&mdash;<i>what</i> a whopper!" she cried. Louie turned
her eyes to Burnett Minor.</p>

<p>"You said uncle. You weren't quite right. That's my
father," she said again.</p>

<p>Burnett Minor's life was full of miracles. A miracle
more or less made no difference. Her eyes sparkled. She
alone of the girls believed.</p>

<p>"Not really?" she gasped.</p>

<p>Louie nodded.</p>

<p>"Qu'est c'qu'elle dit?" Pigou cried excitedly, somewhere
at the back.</p>

<p>"Pooh, she didn't&mdash;she only nodded&mdash;nodding isn't a
lie," a casuist scoffed.</p>

<p>"Stupid, don't you see she's joking?"</p>

<p>But Burnett Minor was watching Louie&mdash;only to be
quite sure.</p>

<p>"Honour?" she cried. "Spit your death?"</p>

<p>"Honour."</p>

<p>"How splen-<i>diferous</i>! And you never told us!"</p>

<p>But Burnett Major had already looked at her sister.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
She was shocked into using her Christian name. "<i>Genista!</i>"
she reproved her.</p>

<p>"Let me look again," said Louie.</p>

<p>She looked again at the man who had been cruel, faithless,
divorced. Again she handed the "Life" back.</p>

<p>"He keeps a public-house up the river," she said.</p>

<p>At that the tension was suddenly relieved. That, of
course, was too much. They breathed freely again. The
derisive clamour broke out.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you see? They've made it up between them&mdash;frauds!"</p>

<p>"Of course they have! Come and finish tea."</p>

<p>"She'll be saying that was the man who brought her
down next!"</p>

<p>"Causton, I'll never, never believe another word you
say!"</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;the housekeeper will be here in a minute."</p>

<p>"Pig, you've stolen my piece of cake that I was saving!"</p>

<p>"Hurl the bread and butter, Mac."</p>

<p>And the crowd which had gathered about Louie dispersed
to the tables again.</p>

<p>Not until ten minutes later, when she had gone up to her
own room again, did Louie begin to wonder what had impelled
her to make her surprising declaration. But in an
instant her ten-years'-old habit of thought asserted itself
again. Why have made it? Rather, why not have made
it? She would have made it sooner had occasion offered.
Elwell and the Burnetts did not drag their fathers in; she
had not dragged her father in either. She had not told
them that her mother was Lord Moone's sister&mdash;it was
known, but she had not told them; why should she have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
paraded the fact that her father was this redoubtable Buck,
from whose beezer the claret had flowed as he had advanced
for the twenty-eighth round? They could have known it
any time they had wanted! Conceal it? Why, had she
not all her life been glorying in that very pride of the
cobbler's dog?</p>

<p>And still, deep down in her, she wondered whether it
had been even that sort of pride, and not rather that secret
hunger of the heart that, while she was "in at" everything,
she was also "out of" everything. Had it been that
that had caused her to say quietly: "That's my father"?</p>

<p>Or perhaps it was even something deeper still. Perhaps,
in a word, it had been her blind groping towards that
crude and strong and cruel and joyous life Richenda Earle
had said she knew nothing about.</p>

<p>She wondered whether the girls downstairs were talking
about her now.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell on the black-framed miniature of the fourth
Lord Moone. Then, as if her brain had received a number
of disordered impressions all heaped one on the top of
the other, she sat down on the edge of her bed, not so
much to think as to remember again exactly what had happened.</p>

<p>Gradually the disorder cleared. Phrases and the tones
in which they had been uttered began to stand forth more
distinctly. Presently she was able to allocate each to its
speaker. It was her first attempt to estimate differences
in the future her declaration might have made.</p>

<p>Burnett Minor, of course, she could dismiss summarily.
To her it had been a high lark, that but endeared Louie to
her the more. But Burnett Major? What about her?
"<i>Genista!</i>" she had exclaimed, shocked at her young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
sister's apparent belief in the socially impossible. Yes, it
would be interesting to see what difference, if any, was to
be seen in Burnett Major's attitude now. And Elwell's
"<i>Oh!</i>" What about that? And Macfarlane's blank
look? And what did Richenda Earle think?</p>

<p>Louie did not know yet.</p>

<p>And what about Mrs. Lovenant-Smith? Undoubtedly
Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, knowing about it herself, would have
preferred Louie to keep silence.</p>

<p>The thought of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, however, always
braced Louie. That curious pleased coldness came into
her eyes again. She would see about Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
by-and-by. In the meantime, the last thing she intended
to do was to absent herself from them all. She would go
down to supper.</p>

<p>She took a clean blouse from a drawer, laid it out on her
bed, and then, reaching for a towel, started for the bathroom.</p>

<p>Before she reached the bathroom, however, one of her
conjectures was already answered. Richenda Earle's cubicle
was on the same corridor as hers, four doors lower
down, and she met Richenda herself, who had come back
from her vacation a week before, by the embrasure of one
of the latticed courtyard windows. It was almost dark;
in the recess the little reflectored oil lamp had been lighted,
and it shone on the Scholarship girl's copper hair and angular
shoulders. Louie stopped. She did so deliberately.
Let Earle allude if she dared.</p>

<p>"You washed?" she said, on a rising note.</p>

<p>"No, not yet. I&mdash;I came up for a book," said Richenda.</p>

<p>"You're not studying to-night, are you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye-es&mdash;oh yes, I must."</p>

<p>"Classification?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"How far have you got now?"</p>

<p>Louie's mood was on her. It was overdue, but it had
come now, and she was challenging Earle. Nevertheless,
she was ignorant of what she really challenged when she
challenged Earle. Hard knowledge of the true weight of
Life will tell, and Earle's knowledge of that weight told
now. The girl's head was downhung, so that the nodule
of bone at the back of her neck caught the light sharply.
Suddenly she looked up.</p>

<p>"But you are Lord Moone's niece, aren't you?" she
said, without preface.</p>

<p>Since her vacation, this daughter of a struggling Westbourne
Grove bookseller had seemed less assertive than
before, and was, somehow, none the worse for it. Louie
didn't know what had made the difference, but she momentarily
dropped her point.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;?" Richenda halted.</p>

<p>"Then what? The other that I told them downstairs is
just as true, if that's what you want to know."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>Earle evidently mitigated what she had been about to
say.</p>

<p>"I only mean that&mdash;that you must have thought it queer,
my talking as I did&mdash;that morning, you know?"</p>

<p>Louie saw the approach of the first attitude for her garner.</p>

<p>"What morning?" she demanded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"When they punished me&mdash;when I was washing the
fruit trees."</p>

<p>"I remember. Well, why should I think anything
queer?"</p>

<p>Earle's head dropped again. Again the sharp nodule
of bone showed.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," Louie said, "that if my father's what
I said, no doubt I know as much about what you were saying
as you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" Earle said, the more quickly that that probably
had been what she had meant.</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Only that it's&mdash;so odd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But suddenly Louie gave her towel a twitch and turned
away. She spoke with her chin over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don't love my mother," she said, "but for all that
she is Lord Moone's sister&mdash;Augustus Evelyn Francis
Scarisbrick, Lord Moone. And the other's my father. I
wouldn't study too hard about it if I were you. You have
your medal to get."</p>

<p>She walked abruptly to the bathroom.</p>

<p>That night, as usual, she sat at supper between Burnett
Minor and Richenda Earle. The ordinarily irrepressible
child on her left was silent; but others, two or three places
removed from Louie, leaned back or forward from time to
time to speak to her. She fancied Burnett Minor had been
crying; she was sure of this when, giving the child's hand
a pat under the table, she felt her own hand impulsively
caught and squeezed. Then, in proportion as Burnett
Minor cheered up (which she usually did very quickly), the
others ceased to talk across to Louie. It was as if, whoever
did it, some normal level of chatter must be maintained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Soon supper was as desultorily talkative as it always was.
Louie, glancing at the top table, saw that Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
knew nothing of what had happened at tea-time.
She was, however, quite ready for her the moment she
should find out something.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">V</p>

<p>One afternoon about three weeks later Louie Causton
had occasion to go into the carpenter's shed. This
shed lay between the dairies and the boiler-house that was
the centre of the hot-water-pipe system, and Priddy had a
frame making there. Half this frame, protected by a
board with "Wet Paint" chalked upon it, leaned against
the outside wall, and, with his back to the sunlit doorway,
a young man, whom at first Louie took to be Priddy, was
doing something at a bench. Hearing her, he turned. It
was not Priddy. Louie did not know him.</p>

<p>There is in the British Museum a small helmeted head
very like the young man Louie saw. It is on the upper
floor, among the Tanagras, in a case on the left as you
walk from the stairs. This young man, of course, was not
helmeted. His face was handsome and slightly vacuous;
his eyes in particular had something of the blankness of the
little terra-cotta head; and his mouth was full and classically
curved, and had the slightest of smudges of dark moustache
along the deeply indented upper lip. A pair of rolling
muscular shoulders showed through his white sweater;
his old trousers were tucked into a pair of wooden-looking
boots; and he was filing something. Louie wondered what
business he had there.</p>

<p>He told her. He spoke in a slow voice, as if he had got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
his explanation by rote. He was there by Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's
permission, he said.</p>

<p>"We had a smash with the centre-board, you see," he
explained. "Crash&mdash;just at tea-time. Izzard wanted to
send it to Mazzicombe, but I told him they'd charge nearly
as much as we gave for the beastly boat. So I'm doing it
myself."</p>

<p>Then, as if his presence within the precincts of a horticultural
college for young women was quite explained, he
bent over his filing again. Louie, who had come for a
couple of boards that had been put aside for her, took them
and went out. She was twenty yards away when she
heard the young man call slowly after her: "I say&mdash;I
ought to carry those for you, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boards were for her bed. This she had removed
from the orchard. The new place lay quite beyond the
orchard, at the foot of the hill between Chesson's and the
sea. There, for the first time on the previous night, she
had had the best of what breeze there was.</p>

<p>It had been the attitude of her fellow-students during the
past month&mdash;or, more fairly, what she had conceived to be
their attitude&mdash;that had caused her thus to remove herself.</p>

<p>It might be too much to say that she was still not as
popular as ever. These things are not demonstrable.
Popular she had been; now&mdash;well, it depended a little more
than it had done. Burnett Minor, of course, would have
eaten from the same plate with her by day and shared her
bed at night had she been permitted&mdash;also had she not left
for her vacation a fortnight before; but Burnett Major&mdash;Louie
was not so sure about Burnett Major. Her attitude
had been more than correct; it had been so correct that
Louie had been put altogether in the wrong. The words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of course, had never been said, but Louie had imagined
Burnett Major's private opinion to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But why didn't she tell us sooner? What earthly difference
does she suppose it would have made? Who cares
about things like that? I dare say her father's just as
good as anybody else's father; for that matter, mother's
grandfather was only a farmer&mdash;mother told us so herself;
but nobody likes being treated as if they were snobs. It
showed a lack of confidence, that's what it showed; and
I don't know&mdash;now&mdash;I mean no girl, unless she <i>wasn't</i>
quite a lady, would&mdash;&mdash;" Louie could supply that part
too.</p>

<p>"I don't care&mdash;I <i>love</i> Causton!" she had also imagined
B. Minor as having sobbed, bold and unconvinced. "He
didn't sky the wiper when his beezer was bleeding, anyway!"</p>

<p>Yes: for Burnett Major, presentation and all the rest of
it lay ahead.</p>

<p>Matters would probably have stopped at that had Louie
herself allowed them to do so; but that would not have been
like Louie. Allow them to stop there? Good gracious,
no! Her cynicism had become bright indeed. <i>She</i> was
not the girl to contaminate the innocent Burnett Minor;
neither&mdash;for she was a Scarisbrick when all was said and
done&mdash;was she going to be driven willy-nilly into the society
of Richenda Earle as company good enough for her.
She could look after herself, thank you. Coventry is no
unpleasant place provided you have the putting of yourself
there, and at any rate her Coventry at the foot of the
hill was cooler at night than the other one. It meant carrying
her mattress and bedding a little farther, but she had
a prizefighter's physique to carry them with, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
more than her nearest neighbour, Elwell, the daughter of
the Treasury mandarin, could say.</p>

<p>It is true that she did sometimes wonder (with Burnett
Major, perhaps) whether she had not inherited also from
the prizefighter something less desirable than his physique&mdash;a
discontented and ill-conditioned nature. But that did
not mend matters. It merely made her, if it did anything
at all, distrustful of herself. And as this is the story of
Louie, virtues and vices and all, her moods must go down
with the rest.</p>

<p>At any rate, rolled in her blanket at the foot of the hill,
she could feel the night wind on her face, and see the stars,
and in her fancy deride or boast of her parentage to her
heart's content.</p>

<p>On the afternoon following that on which she had fetched
the boards from the carpenter's shed she went to the shed
again, this time for a couple of tent-pegs and a piece of cord
for the better securing of her blankets. The vacant young
Tanagra was still there. But this time he was not quite so
vacant. He had had leisure to think of quite a number of
words.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, lifting slow and bashful eyes of the
colour of blue porcelain to Louie, "I've been thinking.
Haven't I seen you before?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yesterday," said Louie shortly. He had had
the bad luck to catch her at her brooding. But he did not
seem to notice her curtness.</p>

<p>"No, but I mean&mdash;before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Isn't&mdash;isn't your name Chaffinger?" He almost
blushed.</p>

<p>"No."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Then she relented a little.</p>

<p>"I was called Chaffinger for a time. My name's Causton.
I suppose yours is Chesson, or you'd hardly be
here?"</p>

<p>"Chesson? Why Chesson? No. Mine's Lovenant-Smith&mdash;Roy
Lovenant-Smith."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Louie. "Then you're right. We have
met before, at Mallard Bois."</p>

<p>Roy Lovenant-Smith appeared to be so relieved at being
rid of a perplexity that he didn't much care if they never
met again.</p>

<p>"I thought we had," he said mildly. "You were Louie
Chaffinger then. I knew you were."</p>

<p>"But what," Louie asked, "are you doing here?"</p>

<p>He radiated simplicity.</p>

<p>"That centre-board, didn't I tell you? Izzard would
make me go halves in the rotten old thing; just look at
her; hardly a shroud on the port side, and the centre-board
was hitched up with a piece of old rope instead of a chain
and down it came the other tea-time. It's the cabin table
as well as the centre-board, you see, and the whole thing
shut up-just like that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He set the inner edges of his hands together and then
closed his palms with a slap.</p>

<p>"All the tea&mdash;jam and all the lot," he said.</p>

<p>He amused Louie. "That was a pity," she said demurely.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it? But I say, I shall be catching it. I
might use the shed, aunt said, but she told me it was a
fixed Rule about men, unless you're a gardener, of
course&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>("An obedient nephew," Louie thought.) "Then I
must go at once," she added.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't like to get you into a row too," said
Roy Lovenant-Smith ingenuously.</p>

<p>"No," Louie agreed, more demurely still. "They have
to be strict, you know."</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Roy Lovenant-Smith heartily.</p>

<p>And Louie left him.</p>

<p>She was hardly out of sight before her laughter broke
forth. "'All the tea&mdash;jam and all the lot!'" she repeated
softly, and laughed again. She scarcely remembered this
delightful young man. When, as a child of eleven, she
had played leapfrog, he could hardly have been more than
seven, and she felt herself to be far more than four years
his senior now. He was the adjutant's son, she supposed.
Well, he would hardly need Chaff's usual extenuation about
his being a bad fellow at all: Louie would be very much
surprised if he had wit enough to be very bad, or, for the
matter of that, very anything else either. Once more she
laughed. At any rate she had to thank him for dispelling
her megrims for the time being. Still laughing softly, she
passed through the orchards, ascended the hill, and sought
her favourite place by the stile at the top.</p>

<p>She had not thought very much about young men. She
had observed them as so many phenomena, obviously superior
to the animals, yet not quite identifiable as beings
with inner experiences akin to her own. They looked at
her irregular mouth and elongated chin, said the things
young men did say, and departed again, taking their various
moustaches and their unvarying smell of tobacco to some
girl of the kind she knew they accounted "pretty." They
were quite different beings from the fairy prince of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
childhood; and since her childhood's days she had grown
gradually, she did not know how, to a fairly accurate estimate
in retrospect of the "little party" to which Chaff had
once taken her, pigtails and all. Her views of marriage too
were coloured by that mixed parentage that made her, she
supposed, not "common" and not "a lady." She would
not marry unless this was clearly understood. What else
there might be in marriage was shadowy, to be considered
after this redoubtable magnanimity was safely out of the
way.</p>

<p>With no young man had she ever had "a lark."</p>

<p>She was, however, more in the mood for a lark now&mdash;not
necessarily with a young man&mdash;than she had ever been
in her life before. "Cau-ston a vingt-quatr'ans&mdash;elle
coiffe déjà Sainte Catherine," the remorseless Pigou had
said: oh, had she? Did she? Moreover, you cannot put
yourself gloomily into Coventry; others must be made to
see that you consider your sequestration the most desirable
of conditions. Indeed, she had said as much to Richenda
Earle only the night before.</p>

<p>Richenda was the only one of the girls who slept indoors,
and Louie, carrying her bed-trappings out from the house,
had come upon Richenda by the little green door of the
espaliered wall that led to the orchards. Richenda had
made an advance, willing, apparently, to forget the snub
Louie had administered after the "Life and Battles" revelation,
and had offered to carry her pillow for her.</p>

<p>"Why do you go so far?" she had asked, as they had
left the orchard behind.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate being disturbed," Louie had replied. "I'd
go right down to the shore if it wasn't for the climb up
again."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"But suppose you wanted anything during the night?"</p>

<p>"What should I want?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I forgot. You don't have headaches. I
have&mdash;frightful ones."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you come out too? There's quite a
jolly place here. I'd help you to carry your things."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got to read," Richenda had shaken her head.</p>

<p>"You'd be heaps better for it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie had not much in common with Richenda&mdash;save
perhaps (she loved little cuts like this at herself) that both
of their fathers were literary. But she had had that rather
brutal snub on her conscience. That had come out
next.</p>

<p>"You do study too hard," she had said, "and&mdash;I say,
Earle&mdash;I'm sorry for what I said that night&mdash;you know&mdash;when
I snapped at you and said you'd your medal to get.
Will you forget that?"</p>

<p>The next moment she had almost wished she hadn't said
it, Earle's hungry gratitude had shown so.</p>

<p>"It wasn't your fault a bit," the red-haired girl had
broken out impulsively. "It was all mine. I ought to
have minded my own business. But I was so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, try sleeping up here," Louie had cut her short.
"It's jolly."</p>

<p>But Richenda had gone on. "I was stupid," she had
murmured.</p>

<p>"I don't know that you were. You see how it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was, I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, as I tell you, I don't think much of my mother's
lot."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>you</i> can say so," Richenda had replied, shaking her
head. Then, as Louie had thrown down her mattress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
"You don't mean to say you undress here?" she had asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't sleep in my clothes."</p>

<p>"But don't your things get wet?"</p>

<p>"I wrap 'em in my waterproof.... You won't come
up, then, and run down to the shore for a bathe before
breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Causton, they'll be dropping on you yet!" Earle had
said, almost frightened.</p>

<p>"Well, without the bathe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should die!"</p>

<p>And Richenda had gone back to sleep where she might
find remedies for her headaches within reach of her hand
during the night.</p>

<p>Louie sat on the stile. The sea had a soft bloom, and
the sky was of the colour of the whites of a baby's eyes.
Bees hummed among the scabious, and blue and sulphur
butterflies hovered over the patches of wild thyme. A
tramp, sullying the air behind her, crept slowly up to Bristol;
a single nodding grass-head near at hand shut her out
almost completely. Mazzicombe, down under the hill, was
hidden. Louie watched it all, thinking of nothing, or, if
of anything, of how sweet it was to relax all her muscles to
the point of not stumbling off the stile, and all her mind
save that she might still be just conscious that she existed
and was Louie Causton....</p>

<p>"Hallo," said a slow, imperturbable voice behind her;
"here we are again."</p>

<p>She started a little. Roy Lovenant-Smith was returning
with a baulk of old wood over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," she said. She did not know whether
she was glad or annoyed to be interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," he replied placidly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>She was silent for a moment; then: "I thought you
hadn't to hang about here?" she said.</p>

<p>"Well," he put it to her candidly, "how can I get over
the stile when you're sitting on it? How can I, now?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "Well, I must get off on my proper side."
She did so. "There," she said.</p>

<p>He climbed over with great deliberateness, walked a few
yards with his piece of timber, and then turned again.</p>

<p>"No, you can't see her from here," he said. "She's
down under the hill there. I don't think she's worth bothering
about, but Izzard says she'll be quite all right with a
new stay or two. I suppose I shall have to get 'em."</p>

<p>Louie felt a return of her amusement.</p>

<p>"Who's Izzard?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Izzard?" He looked at her as if she ought to know
that. "Izzard's the other chap. Always painting, you
know. Painting and mooning about and leaving me to do
all the work. He's away there somewhere now." He
pointed vaguely across the Channel. "I suppose he'll
come back when he's ready. She <i>is</i> an old egg-box!&mdash;I
say, how's your cousin Eric? And that girl&mdash;what's her
name&mdash;Cynthia, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>She didn't know, and told him so; she did not tell him
that she didn't care either. He cogitated for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>"But I say&mdash;what do you <i>do</i> at this place? Seems
funny to me.... Mind yourself&mdash;somebody wants to get
over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had not heard anybody approach. It was Priddy,
going down to Mazzicombe. Louie stood aside from the
stile. Priddy climbed over it and began to descend the
hill. Lovenant-Smith looked at Louie in surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"I say," he said, "that's cool! Don't those fellows take
their hats off to you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Louie. Then she turned her clear grey eyes
on him. She had been fairly caught.</p>

<p>"Don't they? By Jove!... What are you looking at
me like that for?"</p>

<p>The rippling laugh with which Louie replied dropped a
note. "Guess!" she said.</p>

<p>"How can I guess?" he asked, with his innocent and
statue-like stare.</p>

<p>For answer, Louie glanced to where Priddy's brown
bowler hat was disappearing over the edge of the hill. Roy
Lovenant-Smith saw&mdash;he really saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?" he exclaimed. "You don't mean to say that
that chap will&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She nodded. He stared.</p>

<p>"What, get you into a row for talking to me?"</p>

<p>"He may not."</p>

<p>"No, but really, joking apart?" he said incredulously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he won't."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, I say!... Look here, shall I go back with
you and explain?"</p>

<p>The innocent! "I don't think I would," said Louie,
smothering her laughter.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;hang it all! I say, I <i>am</i> sorry!"</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"I mean sorry I've got you into a row, of course," he
amended.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you meant sorry you stopped and talked
to me."</p>

<p>"Of course not. That is, if it doesn't get you into a
row."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"And if it did&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well, a chap doesn't like getting people into rows.
Look here&mdash;that beggar wants talking to!"</p>

<p>Louie dropped her eyes. "I've been in rows before,"
she said.</p>

<p>Instantly he cheered up. "Oh, I see! You mean it
wouldn't be much?"</p>

<p>"Well, your aunt can't exactly skin me." At the recollection
of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith she glanced with satisfaction
at her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll make that all right with her," said Roy Lovenant-Smith
hopefully.</p>

<p>She looked at him. He <i>was</i> an innocent! "You know
what that would mean?" she said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Well, merely that you wouldn't see me again."</p>

<p>His look too rested on her hands. "Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>She straightened herself. "Oh, never mind about it.
I'm going now."</p>

<p>He coloured a little. "But I say&mdash;Louie&mdash;you don't
mind my calling you Louie, do you? I used to, you know.&mdash;I
should like to see you again."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better not," she said, with great demureness.</p>

<p>"Oh, rot!" he expostulated. "A fellow can't get a girl
into a mess and then leave her in the lurch!"</p>

<p>"You'd like to see me just once again, to see whether
I'd got into a row or not?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean."</p>

<p>It wasn't what Louie had meant him to mean, but
"Well, once, if you like," she conceded.</p>

<p>"All right. What about here, at this time to-morrow?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll see if I can get away from my studies."</p>

<p>"Right. And if I see that chap in Mazzicombe, may
I say anything to him?"</p>

<p>"Please don't."</p>

<p>"Not about not taking his hat off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they don't trouble about that sort of thing
here."</p>

<p>"Well, they jolly well ought. All right, I won't.
Good-bye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>He took his board and followed Priddy; she turned back
to the college. She laughed again. At any rate, a lark
with a pleasant image was better than a hole-in-corner, Miss
Hastings affair with a gardener. She would <i>not</i> "coiffe
Sainte Catherine."</p>

<p>She duly got her wigging. She was put "on her honour"
by Mrs. Lovenant-Smith not to see the young man
again who had betrayed the confidence put in him. This
struck her as quite richly arrogant. To be put "on your
honour" by somebody before whom you stand mute as a
fish, and to have it assumed that you accept the bond, was
the <i>largior ether</i> indeed. Louie did not even feel called
upon to say that she declined to consider herself bound.
Mrs. Lovenant-Smith might take her "off her honour"
again. She met Roy scarcely three hours later. The interview
he himself had had with his aunt in the meantime
affected the situation but little; his centre-board was now
patched up, and the withdrawing of the privilege of the
carpenter's shed made no difference.</p>

<p>They met again on the afternoon following that, and
again on the one after that. Louie found herself hoping
that Izzard, whoever he was, would not return from "over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
there" just yet. Let somebody else attend to the hair-combing
of the Saint.</p>

<p class="p2">A score of different things contributed to her enjoyment
of that affair of atmosphere&mdash;her "lark." First, the
initiative was hers&mdash;for her empty-eyed statue accepted
everything with as much candour as if he had been born
into a virgin world on the eighth day of its creation.
Next, the mere disregarding of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith was
a pleasure she felt it incumbent upon herself not to forgo.
Next, there was the instinctive courage with which she
translated her sulks into carelessness and gaiety. Next&mdash;but
allow what you will for the rest: pique, vanity, her
derivation, her upbringing. When, the third time she met
Roy by the stile, the half-French girl, Pigou, came upon
them, and instantly flew to spread the news among such
girls as still remained at Chesson's, Louie's Coventry was
the coveted thing she had all along intended it should be.</p>

<p>For she was more than merely popular now; she was
romantic, apart, a being to be looked up to with something
like awe. Meet a young man! She felt herself to be the
channel by which every girl in the place might have access
to her own dreams. They gave her longing glances, that
mutely implored her to tell them all, all about it; she talked
about everything else, but not about that, and hearts and
mouths watered. They offered to do things for her&mdash;to
carry her mattress, to do her Sunday watering, even to
clean her bicycle; and Louie let them&mdash;but told them nothing.
Nay, she even drew Richenda Earle to herself.
Richenda actually carried her mattress to the foot of the
hill one night and slept out. The two mattresses were
placed not six feet apart, and, as the birds settled on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
boughs and the stars came out, Richenda set herself wistfully
to pump Louie.</p>

<p>Then it appeared why Richenda had seemed changed
since her vacation. Speaking in a low voice, she too admitted
that there was now&mdash;Somebody. Weston, his
name was, Louie learned, and he was some sort of a commercial
schoolmaster at the same place in Holborn where
Richenda herself had studied. So instead of Richenda
pumping Louie, Louie pumped Richenda. What was her
Mr. Weston like? Well (Richenda said), some might
think him an oddity&mdash;the Secretary Bird, his nickname
was&mdash;but he was, oh, a soul so sensitive, so gentle! Was
there any prospect of their marrying soon? Richenda
sighed; it would be a long time; if she got her post at Chesson's
he might apply for a country schoolmastership somewhere
near, and then she would get a bicycle; or if he got
a "rise" in London she might relinquish her appointment&mdash;when
she got it. But in any case it could hardly be for
years. Louie asked flatly what Weston got, and was told
one hundred pounds a year. She looked up in surprise.
Her own dress allowance was treble that amount.</p>

<p>"And you'd get a hundred here too?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If I get the place&mdash;which means if I get my medal,"
said Richenda.</p>

<p>Then, Louie thought, that would be two hundred between
them&mdash;two-thirds of her dress allowance.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;," she said, "I thought people got paid
more than that!"</p>

<p>"I told you you didn't know," said Richenda softly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;why, my aunt paid Miss Skrine one hundred
and fifty pounds, just to go through her engagements,
opening bazaars and charities and so on&mdash;just to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
write down on a slate what she had to do each day!"</p>

<p>"Your aunt's Lady Moone," came from Richenda's
couch.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> she got one hundred and fifty pounds, <i>and</i>
lived with them. One hundred pounds seems absurd."</p>

<p>"That's what father said when he apologised to me."</p>

<p>"But surely, all&mdash;all the people one sees aren't paid at
that rate! Why, some cooks get a thousand&mdash;I've heard
that for a fact&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some don't," came from the other pillow.</p>

<p>"Well, some do, and if you strike an average, or whatever
it's called&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Richenda interrupted, softly and wearily:</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't, don't, don't know."</p>

<p>Louie asked further questions. She frowned, puzzled,
at the answers. Of course Richenda herself wasn't a very
effective sort of girl; if anybody had to be downtrodden it
would very likely be she; but the things she was telling her
now (Richenda had begun to talk again, resignedly rather
than bitterly) were preposterous. There must be something
wrong with Richenda, probably with her Weston too;
she did not look quite right; she was very different from the
rosy housemaids at Trant, for example. One hundred
pounds a year!... She had forgotten all about Roy.
When, presently, Richenda came as near to putting a question
about him as she dared, she forgot about him again.
One hundred pounds a year!... She lay on her back,
her knees up, her hands behind her head, her sleeves fallen
from her wonderful arms, the brows above the grey eyes
knitted. She was sure that <i>she</i> could do better than that!
She even went so far as to say so. Richenda showed no
resentment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"You've got Lord Moone behind you," she said.</p>

<p>"I've got a prizefighter and a public-house behind me,"
Louie replied.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know you think you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie lay awake, still pondering it all, long after Richenda
had fallen into an uneasy sleep.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon she met Roy by the stile
again. She was restless, unsettled, she knew not what.
She spoke almost sharply to him.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to stand here with you," she said;
"that's twice I've been seen. Come down the hill."</p>

<p>Roy no longer urged the Rules. They walked together
a hundred yards down the hill, and sat down under a gorse-bush.
He made her move quite behind it, and even then
tucked her skirt a little farther out of the gaze of a possible
passer-by.</p>

<p>"Now we're all right," he said. "How's Lovey this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't seen her."</p>

<p>"Well, don't bite a fellow's head off, Louie."</p>

<p>"Then don't bother me to-day.&mdash;No, I don't want my
hand held."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"If you don't leave me alone I shall go. I didn't sleep
till nearly daylight."</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep for quite an hour, either," he said sympathetically.
"I say, isn't it funny, Louie, when you
come to think of it, that till a week ago I hadn't thought of
you for years?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't lying awake thinking of you," she said
bluntly.</p>

<p>"I was of you." He put out his hand again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>His approach only made her impatient. "Oh, don't!"
she snapped. "Really I shall get up and go if you worry
me."</p>

<p>He was, as he would have put it, "keen": keen enough
to begin to sulk. She let him sulk, and watched the sea,
always of a milky bloom, and the sky, still of the hue of an
infant's eyeball. After some minutes she turned to him
again.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> people get paid?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"What people?" He spoke over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, people&mdash;you know what I mean!"</p>

<p>"We get dashed little, I know that." (He was going
into the army.) "What sort of people? Servants and
those?"</p>

<p>"And those&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Roy expounded.</p>

<p>"Jolly good pay, <i>I</i> call it; lot of lazy beggars! Why,
the fellow down there wanted to charge me two pounds
for patching up that centre-board, that I did in about
a day. I shouldn't mind getting two pounds a day!...
Why?"</p>

<p>"I want to know."</p>

<p>"Some of your gardeners been grizzling to you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"A wonder&mdash;rotten grousing lot! They ought to have
uniforms to buy, and mess-bills and clubs and things;
they'd know all about it then! Two pounds for filing a
piece of iron and putting a patch on a piece of wood!&mdash;I
think it will hold all right," he continued naïvely; "we
shall make a deuce of a lot of leeway if it doesn't. We're
flat-bottomed, you see, with only bilge-keels, and that reminds
me; Izzard's coming back on Wednesday; I'd a note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
from him this morning. But he won't be in the way, dear,
if you'll only be friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not help laughing. After all, Richenda's
"grousing" was a little spoiling her fun. She turned to
him again.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen her yet," she said. "Let's go down to
her now."</p>

<p>He chuckled mildly. "You do play the dickens with
the Rules, Louie."</p>

<p>"Bother the Rules!"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't want to go just this minute; it's jolly
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time she did not withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>But he was very slow, she thought, in kissing her. He
had never kissed her yet. What was the good of being
caught at&mdash;nothing?</p>

<p>Well, statues (she reflected), especially young ones, are
slow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Even as she was thinking it he did that very thing.
Perhaps it was to summon up resolution to do so that he
had lain awake the previous night. He kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>The result was curious. It was the law of her physique
that most moments of perturbation only turned her paler;
but at this particular form of perturbation she turned suddenly
pink.</p>

<p>In a few moments she was as before. The first sign that
she was Louie again was that she forbade him to repeat the
offence. He sulked again.</p>

<p>"All right," he said resentfully; "then we may as well
go and see the yacht."</p>

<p>"I don't want to see the yacht."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be stuffy about it&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Statues <i>were</i> distractingly slow!</p>

<p>Then she looked at him with a faintly mocking smile.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to say you're sorry?" she challenged
him (but she had for a moment a faint return of the unhabitual
colour for all that).</p>

<p>He seemed to suspect that he was being mocked; nevertheless
it was with a rather tremulous boldness that he answered
"No."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "you did let me hold your
hand."</p>

<p>She caught her breath. Good gracious! Why, he
would be saying presently that she had asked him to kiss
her! "You see, you did let me hold your hand!" What
next?</p>

<p>"You know you did," he argued simply.</p>

<p>Even so it is written, "Out of the mouths of babes and
sucklings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed. O admirable innocence, that
alone can defeat guile! After all, it was too unpardonable
not to be pardoned. She turned her face away again.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> stupid!" she murmured, her face, even her
neck, pink once more.</p>

<p>At that quite a new gleam seemed to irradiate his good-looking
clay.</p>

<p>"I say," he said slowly, as he struggled with the newness
of the idea, "you mean&mdash;do you mean?&mdash;about my not
kissing you&mdash;properly?"</p>

<p>Oh, the heaviness! But he should kiss her "properly,"
as he called it, now!</p>

<p>"Oh," she said briskly, "it's too late now. You can't
very well after that, can you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>But he beamed. "Of course I can!"</p>

<p>"No, Roy!"</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was outrageous. She made as if to rise.</p>

<p>"No, Roy&mdash;no&mdash;you know very well you don't think
I'm pretty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you aren't ugly," said he.</p>

<p>(Great heavens! She "wasn't ugly"!)</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Statue," she thought, compressing those
irregular lips whose degree of prettiness he estimated so
nicely. "I'm going to be pretty in a very few minutes,
and you're going to tell me so."</p>

<p>"No, Roy," she said aloud; "just let's sit and talk&mdash;sensibly&mdash;I
don't know what made you behave like this all
of a sudden&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And there was none to say "Provoking hussy!"</p>

<p class="p2">An hour later they rose. It was too late to go to the
yacht now. They walked together back to the stile.
Their shoulders overlapped. The kisses came easily now.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go aboard her to-morrow?" he said.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"'Once aboard the lugger'&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;but of course she's
a cutter, not a lugger. That's just a saying, 'Once aboard
the lugger.'"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, hadn't you heard it? 'Once aboard the lugger
and the girl is mine,' it is. And I say, you'd better put
some old clothes on if I'm to show you how the centre-board
works."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"What about Lovey?" he asked once more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we write down on a slate where we're going."</p>

<p>He held her a little away. "I&mdash;<i>say</i>!... You
wouldn't tell her where, would you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;cheek!"</p>

<p>"She put me 'on my honour'&mdash;impudence!" quoth
Louie.</p>

<p>"But I say&mdash;what frightful cheek!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a minute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, "'Bye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He called her name after her. "Louie!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, boy&mdash;&mdash;" She waved her hand.</p>

<p>Anyway, she thought with satisfaction, she had made
him say&mdash;swear&mdash;that she was pretty.</p>

<p class="p2">The next afternoon, as good as her word, Louie wrote
on the hall-slate: "Gone to Mazzicombe: L. Causton."
Then she walked, whistling, out of the house and up the
hill.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">VI</p>

<p>This time she fully expected to catch it, and did catch
it. No time was lost. A note from Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
just before supper ordered her to report herself immediately
after that meal. At a quarter past nine she
presented herself.</p>

<p>The French window stood wide open, but night was fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
falling over the front lawn, and a clipped peacock of box
showed against a brownish-green sky. Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
stood by the window. It moved as she turned, and
there swung slowly across the pane the reflection of the tall,
yellow-shaded standard-lamp in one corner. Miss Harriet
Chesson had followed Louie in. In her hand was a piece
of paper&mdash;Louie's "conduct-report."</p>

<p>The beginning of the encounter was no skirmish; its end
was positive slaughter. This is no place for a report of it,
round by round; it must be summarised, even as the "Life
and Battles" summarises the combat between Buck and
the terrible Piker. Louie "led," so to speak, by asking
whether she might sit down, giving as her reason that she
had had a long walk that afternoon; permission was only
refused her after she had put her hand on the back of a
wheatear chair and said again: "I think you said Yes?"
She then placed the chair for Miss Harriet to sit on, as
near as possible to that of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith. She
herself stood in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Miss Harriet, evidently wishing she was somewhere else,
read aloud the conduct-report. It was longish and detailed.
It also, as Louie well knew, did not contain one of the real
points at issue. She looked from one to the other of the
two women. The Lady-in-Charge wore a discreetly-necked
evening frock, with a fichu secured by a mourning brooch;
and her fingers kept touching this brooch, and also kept
leaving it again, as if Louie's eyes had been capable of a
physical plucking of them away. She had had Miss Harriet
in, Louie knew, for moral support. The principal's
dress, too, was a give-and-take between her gardening costume
and conventional evening attire. Her indictment
read, she seemed more than ever anxious to depart. Louie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
for her part, was rather glad that she had been called in.
Buck had always fought better for the eyes upon him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lovenant-Smith began correctly; her first trace of
acerbity showed only when Louie, having listened to her
arraignment with downcast eyes, lifted them for a moment
to make a modest and quite immaterial correction.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to cease this exaggerated deference,
Miss Causton. It doesn't deceive me. It's only a form of
veiled insolence."</p>

<p>Louie heard her indictment out in silence.</p>

<p>First blood was drawn when Louie mentioned the name
of Roy Lovenant-Smith. She called him, with aggravating
naturalness, "Roy." Mrs. Lovenant-Smith rose nearly
an inch in height.</p>

<p>"'Roy!'" she echoed. "'Roy,' indeed!"</p>

<p>"I quite expected Priddy would tell you that first time.
Of course he would. The gardeners here don't like outsiders
intruding," said Louie.</p>

<p>The point told. There was no need to mention the name
of Miss Hastings. Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's face deepened
its ochre.</p>

<p>"Go on, Miss Causton," she said; while Miss Harriet
timidly interposed: "I think that's all you wanted me
for?"</p>

<p>Louie went on. "And anyway, you gave your nephew
permission to come on the premises, which seems to me
quite as much against the Rules as anything there." She
pointed to the charge-sheet.</p>

<p>"Pray go on, Miss Causton," said Mrs. Lovenant-Smith,
swallowing her wrath. Piker Betteridge, counting the
moral advantage to be more than the pain endured, had
formerly been wont to thrust out his undefended jaw in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
order to prove its invulnerability to attack; Mrs. Lovenant-Smith
was doing something of the same kind now.</p>

<p>"Pray go on&mdash;&mdash;" she said.</p>

<p>"And of course that's all bunkum," said Louie, warming,
and pointing once more to the paper in Miss Harriet's
hand. "That isn't in the least what you mean. What you
really hate is my having told the girls what you've had
in your mind ever since I came&mdash;I mean about my
father."</p>

<p>"Pray go on!" The jaw was thrust out once more.</p>

<p>("Perhaps I'd better go?" Miss Harriet still fidgeted.
Seedsmen's daughters are not at their ease at these Olympian
conflicts.)</p>

<p>"All right, I will go on," said Louie, warming still
more. "You would have preferred me to hold my tongue
about it, and if you're thinking of asking me to resign I
should like to say now that probably at least half-a-dozen
others will go with me."</p>

<p>Here, however, Mrs. Lovenant-Smith scored a point.</p>

<p>"That may have been true a little while ago," she said,
"but&mdash;go on." And Louie remembered certain little incidents
and unbendings that had caused it to be indulgently
rumoured that "Lovey wasn't such a bad old sort once you
got to know her." Louie conceded the point.</p>

<p>"Anyway, that's what she does mean," she said, turning
to Miss Harriet&mdash;"that she didn't want me to tell them
that my father was a prizefighter and kept a public-house!"</p>

<p>"Address yourself to me, if you please," ordered Mrs.
Lovenant-Smith.</p>

<p>"Certainly! You've been set against me from the first,
for that very reason; and as for your nephew, I've known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
him for years and years, and you've no business at all to
have him here, and it would sound rather well, wouldn't
it, if the tale got about that you allowed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's hardly held composure
gave way with a snap. Well-born but necessitous
Ladies-in-Charge of horticultural colleges do not submit
to being told their duty by the daughters of pugilists. She
stamped on the floor.</p>

<p>"Silence!" she cried, shaking. "I was a fool ever to
have had you here! You make discipline impossible.
You corrupt your fellow-students&mdash;you make a boast of
your unfortunate parentage&mdash;you show no respect for the
Rules&mdash;you think yourself at liberty to come and go as you
please&mdash;you carry on a vulgar intrigue&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;not with a gardener&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>("Oh, I <i>really</i> must go my rounds!" murmured Miss
Harriet; but she lingered; the spectacle of Olympians forgetting
themselves does not occur every day.)</p>

<p>"&mdash;disgracing yourself among younger and more innocent
girls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;with a Lovenant-Smith, anyway&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the stamp. "I forbid you to mention his name!"</p>

<p>"Roy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave the room!"</p>

<p>("Please, please!" besought Miss Harriet.)</p>

<p>"You will pack your boxes at once!"</p>

<p>"I shall consult Lord Moone's lawyer first. You accepted
my fees&mdash;your college is an imposition from beginning
to end, and I'll see that's known. That will be
another scandal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" choked Mrs. Lovenant-Smith, perhaps with
some hazy recollection of the law of slander in her head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
"You hear that, Miss Chesson? You hear that? You
heard those words?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't quite catch&mdash;ladies&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>"If you didn't catch it, I said the whole place was a
shameless fraud," said Louie calmly.</p>

<p>"Very good. Ring the bell, Miss Chesson!"</p>

<p>But the servant appeared only in time to see Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's
complete collapse. She sank, shaking, into
a chair, and gazed unseeingly into a pigeon-hole of her
desk, as if she might find some help against this devilish
girl there. As she clung (as it were) to the ropes, Louie
let her have it (so to speak) on the beezer.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to be here at all, really, you know," she
said. "You ought to be in one of those places&mdash;you know&mdash;in
the Queen's gift, at Kensington or Hampton Court,
with the dowagers and maids-of-honour. If you like I'll
ask my uncle whether he can't do anything."</p>

<p>And without waiting for an answer she swept out, not by
the door, but by the French window. The reflection of the
yellow-shaded standard-lamp swung again as she did so.</p>

<p>She entered the courtyard by the side door, passed under
the dark yew and the arch beneath the box-room, and made
her way through the orchard. She had reached her pitch
at the foot of the hill before she remembered that she had
forgotten her mattress and blankets. She returned in
search of them. Twenty minutes later she was in bed, her
knees up, her hands clasped behind her head.</p>

<p>She was white with triumph. That woman! Well,
Louie thought she had held her own. She had had the last
word, at all events, and an optic-bunging one too. Now
should she leave, or stay? It was entirely a question of
balance between her desire to see the last of the place and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
her resolve to go at nobody's pleasure but her own. It
might be that she would have to stay another week in order
to avoid the suspicion that she was turning tail. The
fraud of a place!</p>

<p>She lay, pale and victorious, thinking the matter over.</p>

<p>One thing was certain; she would not return to Trant.
She supposed she was vindictive by nature, but that would
merely mean at the most a week's gradually increasing
strain on her temper and then another series of embroilings
with her mother. A philosophic elf somewhere deep within
her&mdash;it was hardly affection&mdash;bade her spare her mother
what she had not spared Mrs. Lovenant-Smith. Why seek
a known trouble at Trant? If she must take trouble with
her wherever she went, she might as well take it to a fresh
place.</p>

<p>Before she was aware they had done so, her thoughts had
flown to the vouched-for but incredible things Richenda
Earle had said about life and London.</p>

<p>Lord Moone had a house, and Captain Chaffinger chambers,
in London, and she knew both. For the rest, her
knowledge of the place was pretty much what Richenda
had guessed it to be&mdash;shops, restaurants, theatres. Of her
five visits two had been spent at Lord Moone's, two at
Cynthia's friends, the Kayes, and one at an hotel&mdash;this not
counting the night on which, having run away from the
convent, she had occupied Chaff's room and had wondered
at his large pincushion, his pictures, and ribboned haircurlers
that he doubtless kept in memory of his departed
youth.</p>

<p>Her father, too, lived in London, or thereby&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She fell to wondering about her father.</p>

<p>There was a full but late-rising moon that night; it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
not yet cleared the tree-tops of the eastern end of the orchard
below. She watched its silver through the topmost
boughs. Already it filled the heavens with a mist of light,
dimming the stars; the glister on near leaves was brighter
than the Plough over her head. Scents of the distant
gardens stole undispersed through the night; that of the
night-flowering tobacco-plant was for some minutes almost
sicklily oppressive; and behind her she heard the scurrying
of the rabbits at play.</p>

<p>It was odd that she thought of her father rather than
of Roy. Somehow only Roy's actual presence had the
power to colour those now pale cheeks of hers. Certainly
it had done so that afternoon. For an hour, aboard the
yacht, the rose-peonies in the garden had been paler than
she. But her father had her thoughts now, and the sum of
them was that she would have given much to be able to
think of him as not cruel, not faithless, not a man who had
had to be thrust back into the ditch whence he had come.
She might have sought him out then.</p>

<p>For she was going to London; that was settled. She
had her allowance, more by a half than the income Richenda
and her Mr. Weston would gladly have married on,
and not one penny more of it would she waste at Chesson's.
The next day or two would almost certainly provide her
with a "good exit." Then nobody would be able to say
she had slunk out.</p>

<p>Oh, if her father had but not been a brute!</p>

<p>The moon cleared the trees, and another too-sweet tract
of the night-flowering tobacco enveloped her. A bird or
two stirred. Some time before she had thought she had
heard the sound of a curlew's whistle, low and not very
near, but she had disregarded it. Now it came again. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the effect it had was to turn her thoughts, tardily and
almost unnoticed by herself, to Roy.</p>

<p>She knew little about yachts; yachting was no pastime of
Lord Moone's; but even her vaunting mood relaxed to a
momentary smile as she remembered the yacht down under
the hill there. Those two boys must be crazy to risk their
lives like that. They had rounded Land's End in her, and
in quite good faith evidently expected the miracle to be
repeated. The only wonder was that the centre-board had
gone before the rest of the crazy fabric. "I told you to
put some old clothes on," Roy had apologised for his vessel,
"&mdash;and I say&mdash;I don't think I'd sit on the table if I were
you&mdash;I'm not <i>quite</i> sure about it, you see&mdash;may have to
send it to Mazzicombe after all&mdash;come on the locker." So
they had sat on the locker&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She had felt safer when, half-an-hour later, she had
clambered down into the little dinghy again. It would be
Davy Jones's locker for Master Roy and his friend Mr.
Izzard unless some fatherly fisherman took them and their
boat in hand.</p>

<p>Then came the thoughts of her unknown father again.</p>

<p class="p2">"<i>Ee-oooo-eee!</i>"</p>

<p>She sat up. The whistle came from the stile up the hill.
And suddenly she knew it was no curlew. It was Roy.</p>

<p>She listened.</p>

<p>"<i>Ee-oooo-eee!</i>"</p>

<p>It was Roy.</p>

<p>She knew he would not seek her farther than the stile.
Had there not been other sleepers just below the orchard, it
would still have been the extreme of his boldness that he
had got so far. But&mdash;she remembered how from the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
she had been the prime mover in their entirely wanton
flirtation&mdash;was it necessarily the extreme of hers?</p>

<p>Then, as the devil would have it, something brought Mrs.
Lovenant-Smith into her head again.</p>

<p>That woman!</p>

<p>All the blood left her cheeks and thronged to her heart
again.</p>

<p>Roy would certainly not pass the stile&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment longer, and then suddenly
got up from her bed.</p>

<p>Her clothes were wrapped in her waterproof; she took
the waterproof and put it on. She thrust her feet into a
pair of slippers. The waterproof was not so long as the
garment beneath it; the moon was now well above the
trees; it showed the hurrying white about her heels as she
walked quickly up the hill. She drew the under-garment
up a little. The waterproof was almost the colour of the
scorched grass. The small shadow that preceded her was
now the thing most plainly to be seen.</p>

<p>Over the stile she saw the shoulder of his white sweater.
Again her caution awoke.</p>

<p>"You might have put a coat on," she said, a little out
of breath. "You can be seen half-a-mile away on a night
like this."</p>

<p>"I thought you were never going to hear me!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! You seem to have been sure I'd come if I did."</p>

<p>"Well, you have come, haven't you?" he answered. "I
say, isn't your hair different?"</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't done for a call, if that's what you mean;
I always do it like that at night, stupid. But I'm not
going to stand here with you as white as a cottage
wall."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon he paid her the only compliment he ever did
pay her&mdash;and that was unintentional.</p>

<p>"It isn't any whiter than your feet, anyway," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to stop a minute."</p>

<p>"Oh, dash it all!" he protested. She did think him
cool!</p>

<p>"Good gracious, how long do you think I <i>am</i> going to
stay?"</p>

<p>"Hardly worth coming for, I call it," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"<i>Thank</i> you!"</p>

<p>"For you, I mean, of course&mdash;as if you didn't know I'd
walk miles&mdash;how you take a fellow up!"</p>

<p>"Well, two minutes."</p>

<p>Two minutes can be a very short time; five minutes had
passed when, making a movement to free herself, she said:
"Let me go now, Roy&mdash;I think we're both as mad as we
can be."</p>

<p>"There isn't anybody about," he muttered.</p>

<p>More minutes passed; then:</p>

<p>"Do you really think my feet are white?" she whispered.
A slipper had come off.</p>

<p>Then, close against his breast, she made an inconsequential,
halting little appeal. "Oh, Roy&mdash;don't go in that
dreadful boat again! You'll be drowned&mdash;I know you
will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Should you care?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Silly boy!"</p>

<p>"No, but should you care?"...</p>

<p>"Roy, let me go!" she ordered suddenly. The minutes
were passing fatally quickly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't let you go."</p>

<p>"Roy, let me go, I say!"</p>

<p>But it was not a command now. It was a supplication&mdash;perhaps
not even that.</p>

<p class="p2">She did not love him; in her heart she knew she did not
love him. He loved her&mdash;years afterwards; only years
afterwards. The thought of her left him&mdash;but it returned
to him, never to leave him again. The moon made the
crest of the hill like day, but the shadows of the gorse-bushes
lay dark on the short grass and stunted bents and
the patches of wild thyme. The moon southed, then rode
less high. In the short night a lamb called; and then the
birds, reaching the shallows of their sleep, gave a drowsy
twittering and went to sleep again. It was the false dawn.
The stars grew a little brighter as a deeper darkness possessed
the earth; then in the darkness a cock crowed.</p>

<p class="p2">They met again on the next night. On the night after
that they met once more.</p>

<p>Only after that did she sit down, alone in the box-room,
in the twilight, to think.</p>

<p>Her boxes were packed and strapped, and the cart was
coming for them from Rainham Magna in the morning.</p>

<p>She wished Burnett Minor had been there. She would
have liked to say good-bye to the child. There was nobody
else it would break her heart to leave.</p>

<p>Yet Roy was still down there under the hill. The
centre-board had gone wrong again. She was to see him at
the stile, in the morning, before leaving. It seemed, somehow,
superfluous.</p>

<p>But she did meet him. His face was set, and he had
forgotten to shave.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't look like that; it wasn't your fault," she said
composedly.</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it was&mdash;&mdash;" he muttered, hands clenched.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" She gave a short laugh. "You've nothing
at all to blame yourself for."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have&mdash;I have."</p>

<p>Then he turned to her. "Louie, you've got to promise
me one thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she stopped him. She knew what he was going to
say.</p>

<p>"That's quite out of the question," she said.</p>

<p>"But look here!" He used the words he had used the
second time they had met. "A fellow can't get a girl into
a mess and then leave her in the lurch. You must marry
me, Louie, if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that she had found a touch of her old irony.</p>

<p>"Not unless, of course?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>But she turned away. "No. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Won't you even kiss me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>But there was a gentleness in her refusal such as he had
never had from her before. Kisses came hardly now.</p>

<h2 class="p6">PART II<br />
SUTHERLAND PLACE</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>
<p class="center b1 p2">I</p>

<p>Richenda Earle could have told Louie Causton
that an allowance of three hundred pounds a year,
paid in quarterly instalments, only permits of a sunny
little bedroom and a charming sitting-room in Lancaster
Gate on certain terms, of which terms a dipping sooner or
later into reserves of capital is certainly one. It is true
that Louie still had capital of which she knew nothing.
She did not yet, for example, count her wardrobe as capital,
nor reflect that if its present standard was to be maintained
money must be set apart for the purpose of maintaining it.
She did not yet count her time as capital, nor write off the
days she classed as days of "looking about her" as so
many obligations against the time when looking about her
would no longer serve her turn. She did not count her
health as capital, nor her wild, resilient spirits, nor her
"placeableness" at a glance among those whose possession
of some capital may be assumed. All she reckoned as
capital was the hundred odd pounds she had placed in a
small but sound bank of her stepfather's recommendation,
and (she had vaguely heard of such things) such additional
credit as the Captain's name might command. But
perhaps it is enough to say that she had this conception of
the potency of the Captain's name.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, her second week's bill at Lancaster Gate
was enough to cause her to send for her landlady, and to
ask that person whether she had not a single room anywhere
empty that might combine the prettiness of her present
quarters with the convenience of having all her belongings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
within a single door. She was conscious of reasonableness,
almost of magnanimity, when she remarked that she didn't
mind going up another flight of stairs. The landlady had
such a room, but pointed out its lack of cupboard-space
and the number of Louie's dresses. That, Louie replied,
did not matter; she intended to sell a number of the older
dresses; and her things were carried upstairs.</p>

<p>Her idea in selling the older dresses was that thereby she
might add another thirty pounds or so to her balance; the
half-dozen she thought she could spare had cost thrice that
amount. The wardrobe dealer who waited upon her offered
her five pounds for them. Louie thanked her, told
her that she had thoughts of going into a business so lucrative
herself, and bade her good-afternoon.</p>

<p>She had come to London at the beginning of September;
before that month was out she had decided to leave Lancaster
Gate. For some reason or other her quarter's allowance
had not arrived, and she wrote to Chaff about it.
Chaff promised to look to the matter. She wrote also to
Richenda Earle, stating the kind of lodging she required,
and asking whether Richenda knew of such an one. To
this last letter she had a reply by return of post. Richenda
proposed the house of her married sister, which was in
Sutherland Place, Bayswater. Without prejudice to her
choice, Louie took a walk along Sutherland Place, and
received an impression of a quiet street with milk-carts
drawn up by the kerb and virginia creeper covering the
houses with crimson. As she passed the door Richenda
had specified, the door opened, and a squarer and older
Richenda came out with a string bag in her hand. That,
Louie thought, would be Mrs. Leggat, the wife of the
estate-agent's clerk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>A week later Louie moved into Mrs. Leggat's first floor-front-bed-sitting-room.
That night she counted her money.
The result of her calculations caused her to jump up, as if
she had thoughts of seeking some occupation or other that
very night. Her quarter's allowance had still not come.
Then Mr. Leggat, a lumpy-headed man with rabbit teeth
and a Duke of Wellington nose, came in to fix a gas-burner
for her, and she fell into talk with him. He wiped his
hands ceaselessly on an old rag as he talked. He told her
it was a pity that Rich had not stuck to her book-keeping;
he himself would have been head clerk by this time had he
had her thorough practical grounding instead of having had
to knock about the world and fend for himself; and he
asked her what sort of a villa-building-site Rainham Parva
would, in her opinion, make. He added that it was nice to
have "the rooms" (he used the plural) let to somebody
they knew something about, and then, having omitted to
shake hands with her on coming in, did so before going out,
and evidently accounted their introduction complete. He
came back presently for a pair of pincers he had forgotten,
left her a Carter Paterson card for her window in case she
should have need of one, said that one of these Sundays
they must all go round to the Earles in Westbourne Grove
to tea, made a pun on the words Earle and Lord, and went
out again. An hour later Louie heard him tiptoeing discreetly
past her door on his way upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>Louie was resolved, however, to put a stop to the "Earle
and Lord" business once for all. She was a Causton, not a
Scarisbrick, in Sutherland Place.</p>

<p>She felt herself to be already on the verge of a new life
that was&mdash;let us say amusing&mdash;precisely in proportion as
it was different from any life she had ever known. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
must be&mdash;if the word may pass&mdash;amused; she told herself
so, clinching the argument by adding that it was far better
to laugh than to cry. She had promised Richenda that
she would call and see her Mr. Weston at his Business
School in Holborn; and this might be&mdash;well, amusing.
She went without loss of time. She took the Oxford
Street bus one morning and alighted at the door of the
School.</p>

<p>She mounted three floors of narrow, old-fashioned stairs,
asked a fair, perky boy, who somehow managed to make a
good suit of clothes look cheap, where she should find Mr.
Weston, and presently found herself introducing herself to
a thin and melancholy-looking man with a sparse and colourless
beard, a pair of silver-rimmed spectacles, and a
gentle and hopeless voice. This was "the Secretary
Bird," then. He shook hands slackly with her, placed a
chair for her in one of the bays of a sort of <span class="blocke">E</span> that was
lined with books of reference, and she listened to his soft,
dispirited voice and to the clicking of typewriters in an
adjoining room. He thanked her for "all her kindnesses"
to Richenda, whatever these might have been, and presently
a skimpy little woman in green plaid, with eyes that
peered quizzically behind spectacles and "destined spinster"
written all over her, tiptoed for a moment at the
end of the bay of books, uncertain whether to approach.
Then the fair, perky boy who made good clothes look cheap
also came up. Mr. Weston said: "Excuse me&mdash;yes, Miss
Windus?" Louie saw that she was interrupting the
morning's work. She rose.</p>

<p>"I daresay we shall see one another again," she said.
"Good-bye."</p>

<p>And, outside on the Holborn pavement again, she said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
herself with decision: "Thanks&mdash;but no Business Schools
for me!&mdash;Poor Richenda!"</p>

<p>Three weeks later she became a student at that very
school.</p>

<p class="p2">There is no puzzle about it. Some things come no less
unexpectedly that they are more than reasonably to be expected.
To put this as briefly as it can be put, she had
merely discovered that an affair of atmosphere had become
an affair of fact. That was all&mdash;nothing more, nothing
less. But that was no reason why she should not be
amused.</p>

<p>The natural thing for young women in such circumstances
to do is to seek their mothers. If Louie did this
natural thing a little unnaturally&mdash;well, she did it unnaturally,
that was all. The row, scene, or whatever it
was going to be, had better be got over; then she could
proceed to amuse herself. She had wired that she was
coming; the Captain had met her at Trant station; but she
had had nothing to say to the Captain.</p>

<p>The Captain, however, had had something to say to her.
At first his mumbling into his moustache had not penetrated
to her intelligence; she had only heard broken
repetitions of "Dear old Mops&mdash;only for a week or two&mdash;knew
you weren't without&mdash;meant to write, but dashed
awkward thing to explain by letter, and was coming up in
a week in any case&mdash;if she stuck fast he'd see what could
be done&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?" Louie had said at last. "What's that, Chaff?"</p>

<p>Chaff had repeated his mumblings. At the end of them
she had gathered that the needy Captain had borrowed the
quarter's allowance that had been entrusted to him for despatch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Louie had merely given a little preoccupied laugh
and patted his hand.</p>

<p>"All right, old boy; don't worry," she had said.</p>

<p>A sample or two of her conversation with her mother
must answer for the rest. For quite twenty minutes the
Honourable Emily's head had been buried in the sofa-cushions,
and the Trant coal-and-blanket charitable account had
lain where it had fallen from her hand&mdash;across her cheek.</p>

<p>"That's all," Louie had ended with hard composure.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;&mdash;" the mother had moaned.</p>

<p>"And as I say, I won't marry him."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you must&mdash;you must!"</p>

<p>"Why? Because Uncle Augustus will say I must?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you must!"</p>

<p>"I'll go and see Uncle Augustus."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't&mdash;you mustn't!"</p>

<p>Then, in an interlude, the reasons why everything must
at all costs be kept from Lord Moone had been brokenly
explained. In another interlude a few minutes later Louie
had invented a fictitious name.</p>

<p>"That conveys nothing to me," Mrs. Chaffinger had
moaned. "What is he?"</p>

<p>Louie had invented a station in life to fit the name. Her
mother's face had disappeared behind the coal-and-blanket
account again.</p>

<p>"And this&mdash;this!&mdash;is your study of horticulture!" she
had half faintingly wailed.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yours was art, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Chaffinger's querulous despair had shown a
weak, vindictive gleam. Both pronouns had been a little
emphasised as she had retorted:</p>

<p>"I married your father!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>It was only a flicker. Her head had gone into the cushions
again.</p>

<p>"That didn't last very long," the devilish girl had commented.</p>

<p>"I married your father, I say&mdash;for your sake," had
come from the cushions.</p>

<p>"That's one of the differences. There are others. If
you're thinking of wiring to Uncle Augustus I'll wait; if
you're not, I'll go."</p>

<p>Lord Moone had been wired for. He had wired back:
"Impossible"; but a second wire had brought him over
post-haste the next morning. The situation had been explained
to him; the peer had walked away for a few moments;
Louie had thought she had heard something about
"our damnable women"; then, coming back, Lord Moone
had abruptly convened a Committee of Ways and Means.
Words like "Impossible ... once in a lifetime quite
enough ... secrecy ... the Continent for a few
months ... institution," had been used; and at one other
alternative Louie's eyes had become hard and chill as ice.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she had come harshly in. "As you say,
all these things may be possible. I decline them all."</p>

<p>Then Lord Moone, whose habit of ordering masses of
men probably misled him into thinking that the ordering of
one young woman who says "I won't" was a comparatively
simple matter, had made his pronouncement.</p>

<p>"Very well," he had said. "Then as head of the family
I order that your allowance shall be stopped till you
come to your senses. You hear that, Emily?"</p>

<p>"You mean you'll starve me out?" Louie had said, with
dancing eyes. Like her father, she came up to time as long
as she could stand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean what I've said."</p>

<p>"Then ring the bell, please&mdash;and don't light that cigar
till I've gone. I shall be ill if you do."</p>

<p>And Lord Moone himself had ordered the carriage in
which she had turned her back on Trant.</p>

<p>Burnett Minor, when Mrs. Lovenant-Smith had surprised
the rebellion in the box-room, had not made herself
more inconspicuous than had Captain Chaffinger during
this scene. Indeed, probably considering that Lord Moone,
his sister and Louie herself formed a quorum, he had presently
been discovered to be not there. But it seemed to be
the Captain's lot to receive and despatch Louie in her comings
and goings, and before the carriage had reached the
lodge he had stopped it and climbed in. Ordinarily, the
whites of the Captain's eyes had yellowish marblings; the
yellow had now deepened to the hue of cayenne. He had
blown his nose repeatedly and violently, and Louie, glancing
covertly at him, had suddenly had a pang. All at once
he had shown his age. Somehow Louie resented his doing
so. People and things you have never taken quite seriously
have no right to come near the tragic. It was as if some
puppet strutting within a proscenium should suddenly
bleed.</p>

<p>"Mops," he had said by-and-by, blowing his nose again,
"that was a lie you told them, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Louie had tried to shut her eyes to Chaff's bleeding.
Her hand had sought his.</p>

<p>"The name I told them? Of course it was, you clever
old Chaff, to see that."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me that, do you, Mops?"</p>

<p>"You?! No, poor old boy, it isn't worth while telling
lies to you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, Mops&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>So, for his private comfort, she had invented for Chaff
quite a new lie, name, station in life and all.</p>

<p>Then: "Oh, Mops, Mops, Mops!&mdash;&mdash;" he had murmured
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Little parties were one thing, but his Mops quite another.</p>

<p>But her anger had stirred again. She had remembered
her uncle's proposals.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what he said&mdash;Moone? No; you'd gone
out. Listen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had tugged unhappily at his moustache as she had
told him, bringing out the words with vehemence and
hate.</p>

<p>"Well, but, Mops&mdash;&mdash;" he had demurred wistfully.</p>

<p>"What, are you going to tell me <i>you</i> think so
too?"</p>

<p>"All right, Mops, all right, all right, old girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Much I care for him and his family name! He could
bully mother into marrying people, but he can't bully
me.... Sorry, Chaff, that was clumsy; we're pals at
any rate. Uncle Gus and his Scarisbricks!"</p>

<p>Her exclamations of contempt had occupied the rest of
the time to the station. Chaff had put her into her carriage.</p>

<p>"You'll let me know where you are and what you're
doing, won't you, dear?" he had pleaded. "I can't let
you go like this!"</p>

<p>"I hardly know where I shall be myself yet. Very
likely I shall go to a Business School; I shall have to do
something, and that's all I know anything about. Anyway,
the bank will find me&mdash;no, you poor old thing, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
course I don't mean the money! Of course I'll ask you for
that when I want it. I've quite a lot yet. Good-bye, old
thing."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>And this time he had not warned her not to run away
with a student of book-keeping.</p>

<p class="p2">She went to the Business School partly (<i>bien entendu</i>)
for amusement, and partly because there would be very
little sense in sitting all day long in Mrs. Leggat's first-floor
bed-sitter in Sutherland Place, Bayswater. Perhaps, too,
Lord Moone helped to drive her there. Her very skin crept
when she remembered the lengths to which he would have
gone&mdash;he, the corner-stone of orthodoxy when such subjects
came up for (very) full-dress debate&mdash;to save that precious
thing, the family name of the Scarisbricks. Louie had
had vanities of person, scores of them; but she had also
the sense of the holiness of the body, and she had had
enough of Trants and Mallard Boises and their masters for
a time. The Business School would be as amusing as
anywhere else; indeed, she knew of nowhere else. Here
she was at last in a London that was not the London of
shops and dinners and theatres and drives in the Park.
She would have the fun&mdash;always the fun&mdash;of it. She
would go with the Leggats to see Richenda's sisters and
that father of hers who had apologised to her for having
brought her into the world. She would learn these unfamiliar
accents that met her ear, breathe this invigorating if
dusty air. She would know what life meant to that skimpy
woman in the green plaid, would inspect that new specimen,
the jaunty boy who made his good clothes look like
an ordinary "reach-me-down." And she knew, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
knowing how she knew, that before long she would be
seeing her father. Sit in Sutherland Place? Oh no, that
wasn't amusing. Besides, she would presently have her
living to earn. She had thought, when Richenda had told
her those dismal tales, that there must be something wrong
with Richenda and that she herself would be able to do
better. Well, she would very soon know.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">II</p>

<p>At Chesson's she had taken her proper place among
her fellow-students at once; it was not her fault if
here, at the Business School, she did not at first so much
make friends as watch a number of amusing phenomena.
She watched them with wonder; all was so very, very different.
The building itself seemed once to have been some
sort of a dwelling-house, for there were cabbagey wall-papers
of a bygone fashion on the walls, broken ends of
bell-wire stuck out from the mantel-sides and the cornices,
and the gas-brackets were old and ornate and grimy.
Louie was conscious of something like a shock the first time
she approached one of the third-floor bay windows and,
looking across the street, saw in the windows opposite men
packing things in brown paper, waitresses carrying trays,
and gas-jets burning in the dark interiors beyond. They
seemed so near. The width of Holborn lay between, but
they seemed to crowd on her much more closely than the
yew at Rainham Parva had ever crowded on the inner windows
of the courtyard. The yew, moreover, was thinned
at intervals, but there was no cutting and lopping the forward-thrusting,
amusing humanity across the way. They
seemed to be caged there expressly for her observation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Well, she was there to observe&mdash;to observe, and, of course,
to be amused.</p>

<p>Her new companions, too, were unlike anybody she had
ever known; they no more resembled them than the sweet
heavy airs of Chesson's resembled these diverting smells
of dust and damp and bad ventilation and the whiff of the
Holborn pavement below. Their accents (amusing, however)
struck her sharply; their faces&mdash;alert, sophisticated,
highly entertaining but without candour&mdash;no less sharply.
They too, like the buildings across the way, seemed to ignore
intervening space and to press intrusively forward to
look at her. She was glad that the first thing she had done
had been to stop Mr. Weston's mouth on the subject of the
Scarisbricks and Lord Moone; half the drollery of her experience
would have gone had these people known who she
really was. And the things these slovenly voices said had
no candour. They struck her as a series of (merry) "scorings-off,"
a succession of (cheery) "chippings" of one another.
If their reticences seemed all in the wrong places,
and hand in hand with their defensiveness went an eager
volubility about the things Louie would have kept to herself,
why, so much the more laughable the whole joke.</p>

<p>She had been only just in time in extorting her promise
from Mr. Weston. She was sure of this from his manner
of speaking to herself. It was extremely, syllabically distinct.
To words that he had been pronouncing correctly
and without thought all his life he gave (as if he must find
something superior for her, and knowing better all the
time) pronunciations marvellously new. He found new
words, too; must look 'em up, Louie thought, in the dictionary.
Richenda, who had begun by being his sweetheart,
became his "intended," and once even his "inamorata."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
But he was to be trusted. Louie saw that. If he gave
away her identity at all it would be only by the portentousness
of his secrecy. As a matter of fact he never did so.</p>

<p>It was the skimpy woman in the green plaid, Miss
Windus, who answered most of Louie's questions about her
new companions. She too was a delightful novelty to
Louie. As if to make her own position quite clear at the
outset, she had confided to Louie at once that she herself
was "partly independent." Seeing Louie's slightly
puzzled look, she had gone on to explain that by this she
meant that she enjoyed an income of perhaps a pound a
week "on her own." With this title to consideration thoroughly
understood, she went ahead. When Louie asked a
question about the high-heeled little Cockney Jewess, Miss
Levey, Miss Windus answered it in terms of her own pound
a week. "Miss Levey?" she said. Oh, she'd nothing;
she lived at home and had her fees paid for her, of course,
and wouldn't stick fast, being a Jewess, not she; but Kitty
didn't suppose Miriam Levey had one shilling to rub
against another; not, that was, "on her own." Louie,
finding other questions answered from this same standpoint,
took her cue and framed her questions accordingly. Had
the other female student (there were only four women),
Miss Soames, anything? Well, Kitty didn't know; she
fancied her aunt must have a tidy bit coming in; they
lived together in a boarding-house in Woburn Place, and
as the aunt did nothing all day perhaps she too was partly
independent, or even wholly so. Had Mr. Merridew, the
swaggering boy who cheapened his clothes so curiously, a
tidy bit coming in? Here Kitty evidently had a tale to
tell. Had Archie Merridew a bit coming in, indeed!
Why, his father was Mr. Merridew of Merridew and Fry's,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the fancy stationers with branches everywhere, so Louie
could judge for herself whether that meant a bit or not!
Archie a bit? Why, Mr. Merridew Senior had retired, and
lived at a big place near Guildford, with a tennis-lawn, if
you please. Archie Merridew a bit!&mdash;Then what about
Mr. Mackie? (Louie might have been estimating people
by what money they had all her life.)&mdash;Mr. Mackie? No,
Kitty shouldn't think Mr. Mackie had very much, but he
had a splendid "permanency" offered him when he had
passed his examinations, as an auctioneer's clerk, four
pounds a week to start with&mdash;to start with, mind you&mdash;and
a "rise" every year. Yes; Mr. Mackie was all right,
and, oh dear! <i>wasn't</i> Mr. Mackie funny?</p>

<p>Louie thought this Mr. Mackie more than funny; in her
inexperience of the type she could never believe he was
quite true. For Mr. Mackie sang songs, imitated music-hall
artistes, could "gag" for a whole day on end, and
never forget for a moment the immense success he was.
He fascinated Louie. "Ladies and bipeds in trousers!"
he would begin, with rapid gestures and still more rapid
speech, "before the applause I am waiting for has had time
to subside&mdash;good word, subside&mdash;(thank you, Cuthbert,
you can take the bouquet round to the stage-door)&mdash;as I
was saying when Fitzclarence interrupted me, ladies and
tripeheads in blouses, whoa, backpedal, never mind&mdash;as
I was saying, I will now endeavour to give you my celebrated
imitation of Roderigo the gasfitter at one o'clock
on a Saturday with the thirty bob in his pocket and Hildegarde
Ann his wife licking the paint of the lamp-post at the
corner to squench her thirst&mdash;<i>heu</i>, her thirst!... Chord
on, please, titillate the catgut, Professor, and take firm hold
of his hand, girls&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>Then, while the eyes of Lord Moone's niece would grow
bigger and bigger, would follow the performance.</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> he funny!" Kitty would giggle, faint with laughing;
"oh, give us some more, Mr. Mackie!"</p>

<p>And Kitty, like Saint Paul, died daily at yet another
trick of Mr. Mackie's&mdash;the putting of his handkerchief to
his nose, and the drawing of it slowly downwards to the
accompaniment of a piercing whistle.</p>

<p>But Louie was only moderately amused by young Merridew.
Mr. Mackie had his own perfection; but vulgarity
<i>with</i> a tennis-lawn! "Good gracious, no," said Louie.</p>

<p>She had entered the School as a day student; but within
a week she had put her name down for the evening classes
also. Even then she had the evenings of Tuesdays, Thursdays,
Saturdays and the whole of Sunday quite unamusingly
on her hands. She did not want time on her hands.
As much Mr. Mackie as you pleased, but no time on her
hands. So she joined the classes that met on the evenings
of Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>On her very first evening she saw a student whom she
had not seen before.</p>

<p>She had taken a text-book on Elementary Book-keeping
from one of the shelves of the <span class="blocke">E</span> of books in which she had
had her first talk with Mr. Weston (who, by the way, had
said that he would like to see her for a few minutes before
she left that evening), and finding a chair within the recess,
had sat down where she was to read it. She had not looked
up when somebody had passed the mouth of her little compartment
and entered the next one. She had heard a book
taken down from a shelf behind her, and, after some minutes,
put back again; and had she not chanced to straighten
her back at that moment she would probably not have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the man repass. She had no time to notice more than that
he was very big and not very well dressed. She went on
with her reading, wondering, in the intervals of her slack
attention to her book, what Mr. Weston wanted with her.</p>

<p>She saw the big man again at the close of the class.
This time he was standing at the head of the stairs, waiting
for young Merridew. He really was immensely big, so big
that a too prolonged first look at him seemed unpleasantly
like impertinent curiosity. Indeed, he seemed already to
feel her eyes upon him, for he moved as if to look back at
her in turn; but young Merridew came up at that moment
and they went out together. The big man's head and shoulders
were to be seen beyond the handrail for quite an appreciable
moment of time after young Merridew's had disappeared.
But she had been wrong in thinking that he
wore a shabby suit. His suit might be shabby also, but
it could not be seen. He wore, and had apparently worn
in class also, a tawny old ulster of yellow and black check.
In spite of its age it seemed somehow a better garment than
did the more expensive clothes of his companion. He did
not, however, strike her as very amusing.</p>

<p>She turned away to seek the Secretary Bird&mdash;Mr. Weston.</p>

<p>For the moment Mr. Weston was engaged. He was
standing near the lecture-room blackboard, talking to the
girl who lived with her partly independent aunt at the
boarding-house in Woburn Place. Louie had already remarked
the likeness of this girl, who might have been
twenty but looked younger, to Polly Ross, the pretty
daughter of the tipsy veterinary surgeon at Trant. Polly
too had sported that running of pale blue ribbon beneath the
openwork of what Kitty Windus called her "pneumonia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
blouse," and the clumps of dark hair on her nape too was
like Polly's, and she had Polly's dark and sidelong glance,
and highly conscious air of unconsciousness when that
glance had attracted what it had probably been meant to
attract, attention to herself. She had a copy of the Pansy
Library in her hand, and Louie smiled as she remembered
Burnett Minor and her spoutings. She waited until Weston
should be at liberty.</p>

<p>As she waited, Kitty Windus, wearing an Inverness cape
and a boat-shaped hat, came up. Miss Windus lived in a
street off Tottenham Court Road, and already once or twice
Louie had walked with her as far as the Oxford corner.
She was waiting for the Polly Ross girl now, whose direction
was the same. She asked Louie whether she intended
to walk or to "hop on a bus." She always spoke in these
rather sprightly terms, just as she always stiffened the line
of her back a little the moment a man, any man, entered
the room; and she referred, brightly and hopefully, to proposals
of marriage as "chances." Louie was already
learning when she might expect any given one of Kitty's
innumerable <i>clichés</i>, and had several times (humorously)
given them back to Kitty again with complete success.
As they waited for the Polly Ross girl (whose name was
Evie Soames) Louie asked Kitty who the big man who had
gone out with Mr. Merridew was.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Mandrill!" said Kitty, laughing even before
Louie had got out the word "big." "That's Mr. Jeffries.
Isn't he a caution? But he only comes in the evenings."</p>

<p>She meant that Mr. Jeffries had not a pound a week on
his own. Students who only came in the evenings were
of a slightly inferior order to those who came during the
day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose he had his brown paper parcel with him?"
Kitty said, with more mirth in her peering little
eyes.</p>

<p>Louie remembered that Mr. Jeffries had carried a brown
paper parcel. Kitty twittered.</p>

<p>"Bet you can't guess what was in it&mdash;that is, if you
haven't heard it?"</p>

<p>She said "it" as if it had been a riddle or some sort of
a joke. Louie admitted that she could not guess what had
been in Mr. Jeffries' parcel.</p>

<p>"Good old brown paper parcel!" Kitty chuckled.
"You'll get to know it by-and-by! You see," she explained,
"he goes to Archie's for a bath. Isn't it killing?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't quite see what you mean," said Louie. She
honestly did not.</p>

<p>"Why, for a bath&mdash;you know, a common or garden bath,
with hot water. I peeped into it once (the parcel, I mean;
for shame, you dreadful girl!) and it had a clean shirt and
a pair of socks in it. I suppose he wraps those he takes
off up when he's done."</p>

<p>Louie's eyes had opened very wide indeed. A man to
have to ask another man for a bath! Well, that was something
learned about London! A bath&mdash;a thing so necessary
that its existence was assumed&mdash;how extremely amusing!
She knew that entertaining word, "poor," but what
was this other, this new and side-splitting word that meant
that a man had to ask another man for a bath? She had
never heard of anything so&mdash;so&mdash;there was no adjective
that quite fitted the humour of it.</p>

<p>The next moment she had wasted an irony on Kitty.</p>

<p>"Hasn't he&mdash;a tidy bit?" she asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>But it took far more than this to get through Kitty's
hide. She gave another little laugh and drew her gloves
more smoothly over her thin hands.</p>

<p>"Him? The Mandrill? (I always call him the Mandrill,
my dear.) Not a penny to bless himself with; look
at him!"</p>

<p>"Nor a permanency?" Louie asked.</p>

<p>"What, with those clothes? I ask you, now: it isn't a
cold night to-night, is it? Well, why does he keep that
heavy old coat on all the evening? Enough said, my dear.
He works somewhere in the City, I believe&mdash;'something
in the City'&mdash;sounds most prosperous, doesn't it? And
Archie's awful kind to him, I think, but of course he is
frightfully clever, and does help Archie with his work
sometimes, so Archie gives him a bath (I don't mean what
you mean, I mean lets him have one). Here's Evie. Are
you coming along?"</p>

<p>But Louie, besides being tickled, smarted a little too.
To have to beg for a bath&mdash;and then to have the gift made
a matter of common knowledge and a joke!&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, if these people were different, differences, after all,
were what she was here to see.</p>

<p>She turned to Mr. Weston.</p>

<p>What Mr. Weston wanted to say to her she could not
guess; but he had hardly spoken twenty words before she
was smiling at herself for not guessing. The examinations
were to be held just before Christmas, and unless Louie
could be ready for her Elementary by that time she would
have a good many months to wait before she could enter for
the examination again. What Mr. Weston had to propose
was, in a word, that he should coach her privately.</p>

<p>She knew what that meant. It meant that he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
come to Sutherland Place on Sundays and talk about Richenda.</p>

<p>Well, even talk about Richenda would make shorter that
<i>dies non</i>.</p>

<p>"It really would be a great furtherance of your aims,
Miss Causton," Weston said wistfully.</p>

<p>Louie smiled at the periphrasis, and then considered.</p>

<p>"It might be the best thing to do," she said; "but of
course I should accept it only on one condition."</p>

<p>"May I venture to inquire what that condition is?"
Weston inquired deferentially.</p>

<p>"That you let me pay you for it," said Louie promptly.</p>

<p>But Weston put up a peremptory hand. "Oh no&mdash;no,
no, no&mdash;I should be ashamed after all your kindnesses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie laughed again. "Good gracious, what kindnesses?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you once shielded an individual very dear to me
and took the blame upon yourself, Miss Causton&mdash;&mdash;"
His tone was reverential, his eyes did her homage. Louie
had forgotten all about the box-room rebellion and Mrs.
Lovenant-Smith. She laughed once more.</p>

<p>"Well, just as you like. But no pay, no coaching, that's
all."</p>

<p>Weston sighed. No doubt his acquiescence cost him a
pang. If he took money for giving lessons, lessons he must
give, and the talk about Richenda must go.</p>

<p>"Do you dwell on the point with insistence?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"I am far from denying that it would be of some assistance
in the furnishing of our future nest, if I may use the
expression&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course it would. So that's agreed?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"So be it," said Weston.</p>

<p>Louie half expected him to add: "Amen."</p>

<p>She was in the habit of dispensing money a little largely,
and for the present she could quite well afford to do this.
For Chaff had done more than pay his debt. That very
day she had had a letter from him, forwarded by the bank.
He had paid one hundred pounds into her account, asking
her to regard the extra twenty-five pounds as interest on his
unceremonious borrowing. But she did not for a moment
believe his cheerful tale that "things were all right again
now"; poor old boy, ten to one he had borrowed pretty
ruinously elsewhere in order to pay her. At all events,
Weston should not give up his Sundays for nothing, and she
might, after all, allow him an outpouring about Richenda
and the future nest once in a while. It was only half-a-crown
a week.</p>

<p>But as she left Weston she was thinking of something
else that half-a-crown a week had power to buy. Half-a-crown
a week would have bought this big shabby student a
bath almost every day.</p>

<p>To have to carry a change of underclothing in a brown
paper parcel to another man's place&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And to have that parcel peeped into&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>How damnable&mdash;no, how funny, she meant!</p>

<p>In the light of her knowledge of this extraordinary economy
Mr. Jeffries had to practise she felt&mdash;she didn't know
why&mdash;almost shy in his presence the next time she saw him.
She felt that she possessed something of his&mdash;namely, this
knowledge&mdash;which she ought not to have possessed. She
wondered whether he knew how he had been given
away. Something about him almost suggested that he
might.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it was his mouth. It looked, except when he
deliberately opened it, as if it might very well not have
opened during the whole of the twenty-eight or twenty-nine
years Louie guessed him to have had a mouth at all. The
rest of his face, which would have been too large for any
man less huge, was an unrelenting slab. It was in the
mouth if anywhere that sensitiveness must be looked for.
Certainly there was none in the eyes. These Louie found
(it was on a Wednesday night that she noticed these things;
she had seen him first on a Monday) remarkable. They
were the eyes of a lion&mdash;clear amber, sherry-coloured.
They were made more than ever to resemble the eyes of a
lion by that tawny ulster he never removed, and she remembered
Kitty's sinister and mirthful suggestion. Did
his keeping on of that ulster mean something hardly less
stark and laughable than the circumstance of the bath itself?
(Louie felt that she was learning.) Then she
noticed his hands. She always noticed hands. He
stopped in passing to pick up a pen for her. The hand
that returned it was not only a magnificent engine of sinew
and bone and muscle, powerful and heroic; it was also
(this was not so funny) exquisitely kept. Her own hand,
pale and slender as the leaf of a willow by contrast with
his, was not in its different way more perfect. He might
cadge for a bath, but his hands he could look after himself
for nothing. And that was true of his hair also. It was
tawny, close-cut, and took the light as cleanly as a new silk-hat;
hair-brushing was evidently cheap also. The man did
what he could. She would have liked to hear his voice,
but he handed her the pen in silence and passed on.</p>

<p>"Well, he looks forbidding," was her comment on him
as the great church-door of his back disappeared into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
typewriting-room, "and he has got too big a face and a
rather frightening jaw; but he does shave it properly, and
I don't see where the 'Mandrill' comes in&mdash;wretched little
creature with her pound a week! And he is like a lion,
with those eyes and that ulster&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And merely because he seemed to be a person to be scored
off and given meanly away, she was already prepared, had
she been challenged, to vow that he was handsome&mdash;in his
heavy and unhumorous way. As a matter of fact, if Roy
Lovenant-Smith resembled the little terra-cotta head in the
Tanagra Gallery of the Museum, this Mr. Jeffries suggested
something from the Assyrian Gallery downstairs&mdash;something
in black basalt, that might carry the doorway of
a temple on its head. In any case, with the ulster, the
eyes, and the silky tawny hair, he was as like a lion as
needs be.</p>

<p>When she had seen him twice only she took it upon herself
to snub young Merridew on his behalf.</p>

<p>She and Kitty were leaving the School at four o'clock on
the Thursday afternoon when the son of the fancy stationer
joined them, and, taking it quite for granted that his tidy
bit and his tennis-lawn made him as desirable to Louie as
they evidently exalted him in Kitty's eyes, walked westwards
along Holborn with them. He wore a new red
waistcoat with brass buttons, and perhaps it was in order
to live up to his splendour that he made Louie an offer
which she curtly declined. They were passing a confectioner's
shop; perhaps he noticed&mdash;for he seemed a sharp
enough little bounder&mdash;Louie's glance at the window; he
turned to her.</p>

<p>"Like some chocs?" he said.</p>

<p>Had Louie not already detested him, this would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
been quite enough. Priddy would have had less appalling
manners. As it happened, she would have liked some
chocolates; lately she had craved for chocolates as much as
she had hated the smell of tobacco; but she wanted no chocolates
of this young man's buying.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she replied; and presently she contrived
to put Kitty (the straight-backed Kitty whom a man
accompanied) between Mr. Merridew and herself.</p>

<p>She had the outside berth of the pavement, and she was
wondering whether she would not cross the road and hop on
a bus, leaving Kitty and the heir to the tennis-lawn together,
when something Kitty said detained her. It was
something about Mr. Jeffries. Hitherto Louie had hardly
been listening.</p>

<p>"&mdash;oh, Jeff!" Merridew was saying. "He'll have to
go till we come back. Anyway I shall save half-a-cake of
soap."</p>

<p>"There's such a lot <i>of</i> him," Kitty giggled. "How
big's your bath?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's an awfully useful coach for the Method
exam., I will say that for him; so we'll call it a fair swap.
You know Evie's aunt, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Thought you did. Good old Aunt Angela! (She always
gets ratty when I call her that.) I didn't know she
was an old friend of the pater's till we saw 'em at the Zoo
that Sunday. So that's why they're coming."</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps, perhaps not," said Kitty archly. "Perhaps
it isn't the aunt they want to see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A passer-by elbowed Louie off the pavement; all she
caught of what followed was Kitty's laugh.</p>

<p>"So that accounts for the new blouse! You never think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of asking <i>me</i> down to Guildford, Archie!" she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You must get a chaperon," Archie replied gallantly;
"can't be did without, Kitt-oh. The mater don't allow
running after yours truly."</p>

<p>Then of another light passage Louie heard only the concluding
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" Archie was saying knowingly; and
Louie heard something else about apron-strings. "Pale
blue baby ribbon ones, eh what?" Archie added, with a
grin.</p>

<p>"Archie!" Kitty reproved him.</p>

<p>"Oh, come off it!" replied the fancy stationer's son.
"As if a fellow hadn't eyes! If you girls <i>will</i> wear pneumonia
blouses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Archie, you're dreadful!" said Kitty, deliciously
shocked.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a tannersworth at the Holborn Public Baths
for Jeff next week-end&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Louie interposed. Even amusement can be too
rich. "Good-bye," she said, "there's my bus."</p>

<p>She heard Kitty call after her something about the penny
stage, but by that time she was half-way across the road.</p>

<p>Brass-buttoned little beast!</p>

<p>She got on her bus.</p>

<p>But a quarter of a mile farther on she descended from it
again. She wanted to buy chocolates for herself. She
bought them, walked to the Marble Arch, and there turned
into the Park. She ate the chocolates as she walked.</p>

<p>Little animal! He appeared to keep the whole School
posted about Mr. Jeffries' personal habits. He could not
go down to his home for the week-end, taking the Polly Ross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
girl and her aunt with him apparently, but Mr. Jeffries
and half-a-cake of soap must be dragged in. And that
pathetic, pathetic care the man took of his hair and hands!
For all that, as she strode along, crunching her chocolates,
she became almost angry with him too. Was soap so
frightfully dear, and was there no water anywhere but at
Mr. Merridew's rooms? She could not understand a man
who had any sensitiveness at all suffering his mind to be
turned over and inspected and thumb-marked by these people
in this way.</p>

<p>Still, she must not forget that these things were diverting.</p>

<p>There was no class that night: Louie forced herself to
apply herself to her book-keeping until half-past nine, and
then went to bed. That, as has been said, was on a Thursday.
On the following evening, feeling indisposed to
work, she moved about the School, amusing herself to her
heart's content. She was getting adept in the sport of it.
She bandied back to Kitty Windus, with whom she found
herself in talk, half-a-score of her own expressions: "Beg
yours," "Granted," "As the poet says," and the like; and
she all but openly stalked Mr. Mackie for the sake of the
pearls that rippled from his lips. If Mr. Mackie had
offered to take her for a walk or to a shilling hop at the Holborn
Town Hall on the next blank evening, Lord Moone's
niece, who must allow no chance of amusement to slip her,
would have let him. Indeed, she was in two minds
whether or not to go to this last place of entertainment
alone.</p>

<p>It was not for another week that her amusement at the
School in general and at Mr. Jeffries in particular became
almost painfully ecstatic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p class="center b1 p2">III</p>

<p>On that Friday afternoon she did not go home as usual
to Sutherland Place to tea. She went instead to the
tea-shop across the street the waitresses of which seemed to
crowd upon her as if the width of Holborn did not exist.
As she sat down at her little marble table she glanced involuntarily
across to the windows of the Business School
and for a moment dropped the mask to herself. "Dingy
place!" she thought; "well, we're a dingy crew inside it."
Then, after a long, long walk down Chancery Lane and
along the Embankment almost as far as the ship-breakers'
yard at Millbank, she returned to evening class.</p>

<p>It was the evening before the day when Polly Ross&mdash;she
begged her pardon, Miss Evie Soames&mdash;was to go with her
aunt to the house with the tennis-lawn at Guildford.
Young Merridew was not at the School that evening; indeed,
he had only been once in the evening all the week, and
then, Louie had thought (dropping the mask for another
moment) he had better have stopped away. In a word, she
had not been sure that he had been entirely sober. But
perhaps in that she had been wrong. It didn't matter.
She set a wide difference between the gaieties of the sons
of fancy stationers with a tidy bit coming in and such diversions
as that to which her stepfather had once taken her,
pigtail and all. Besides, if people didn't drink liquor she
supposed her father would not be able to sell it.</p>

<p>On two occasions already during the past week that mask
of her amusement had not so much fallen off as been
twitched off before she herself had been aware. Very remarkably,
both times the big leonine student, Mr. Jeffries,
had been the twitcher. In both cases the actual incident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
had been the same&mdash;a glance, nothing more. But those
two glances had set Louie very curiously indeed waiting to
see whether a third surprise of the same funny kind would
follow them.</p>

<p>The glances had been given by Mr. Jeffries, and they had
been directed towards the Soames girl. There had seemed
to Louie to be an extraordinary unfitness about them.
Had the red-waistcoated boy stolen those glances Louie
would have thought no more about it; he and Polly Ross
were pretty much a pair; but they had surprised her coming
from the other. Louie had been sure that on the first
occasion Mr. Jeffries had fancied himself to be unobserved,
for he had looked stealthily round about him, had waited
for a moment, and then, moving his eyes only, had given
that long, slow, daring, masterful look. This had been
on the previous Monday evening, in the general room. A
few minutes later Mr. Jeffries had gathered up his papers
and had stridden past Evie Soames as if he had been unaware
of her existence.</p>

<p>Even had something very similar not occurred again on
the Wednesday evening, Louie would hardly have forgotten
that look; but it had been repeated. But this time,
finding Louie's eyes on him, he had seemed to guard himself,
to busy himself quite fussily with his papers, and a
little to overdo his sudden affectation of indifference.
Louie admitted that it would be at her own risk that she
put any interpretation that was not amusing on these
trifles; but about the glances, their surreptitiousness and
the man's deliberate attempt at concealment, there had been
no doubt whatever. Polly herself, Louie had to admit, had
been quite unconscious of either look. To all appearances,
she had been thinking of nothing but of the new novelette
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
in the Pansy Library, or else wondering whether the new
pair of shoes she was to go down to Guildford in would
come home in time.</p>

<p>On that Friday evening Louie again found herself a
little less inclined for amusement than she knew to be good
for her. She supposed she ought to work, for if book-keeping
and typewriting and so forth were to be her living
they might just as well be taken seriously; but she preferred
to work where gossip was going on. So she began
the evening in one of the days in the <span class="blocke">E</span> of reference books,
where Miss Windus and the thick-lipped Miss Levey were
sitting on the short library-ladder, whispering and tittering.
Louie opened one of the windows, for she found the
place airless, and then idled towards her two fellow-students.</p>

<p>She had gathered that Miss Levey did not like her.
Miriam Levey was far less stupid than Kitty Windus, and
it was not safe to hand her <i>clichés</i> back to her. Indeed,
she had given Louie a far too intelligent look when Louie
had gratified this hunger for humour of hers at the unconscious
Kitty's expense; and Louie had told herself that
it might be as well to be a little more careful. They looked
up as Louie joined them, but did not exclude her from their
talk.</p>

<p>"I <i>vill</i> find out who she is!" Miss Levey was saying&mdash;her
W's did sometimes become V's. "I shall plague him
till I do!"</p>

<p>"He won't tell you, my dear&mdash;not if he wouldn't tell
Archie."</p>

<p>"But did Archie actually say 'engaged'?"</p>

<p>"Well, a person's either engaged or not, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh no, my dear, not by long chalks! Vy, you might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
as well say that Archie and Evie are either engaged or
not!"</p>

<p>"Well, they aren't&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"'Yet'&mdash;there you are!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll bet they aren't, even after this week-end.
Why, they're no age! <i>I</i> don't believe in getting yourself
engaged and done for before you've had a good look
round!" Kitty tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Vill you bet they aren't engaged in three months?"
said Miriam Levey.</p>

<p>No, Kitty wouldn't bet that. She returned to the original
subject, whatever that had been.</p>

<p>"It's all very well to say you'll find out, Miriam, but&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>Miss Levey tittered, and then suddenly said: "Ssss&mdash;I'll
show you now! Just you watch me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She slipped noiselessly round to the cords of the window
Louie had opened a few moments before.</p>

<p>No doubt her sharp eyes had seen Mr. Jeffries approach.
She gave him a helpless look, and he took the cords from her
fumbling hands and closed the window for her. It was the
more cleverly done that she detained Mr. Jeffries and managed
to get closed the window which Louie wanted open at
one and the same time. She turned her prominent brown
eyes in gratitude to Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you so much! You see, I've got rather a
cold, and I'm going to a dance and don't vant to make it
any vorse," she explained. "You don't dance, do you, Mr.
Jeffries?"</p>

<p>But Mr. Jeffries merely replied "No," and turned away
at once. Miss Levey turned to Kitty again.</p>

<p>"He needn't think he's put me off!" she said. "I <i>vill</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
find out! I shall offer him some tickets now, for self and
lady. And I bet if she dances I'll make him buy them!"</p>

<p>Kitty tossed her head. "<i>I</i> should expect the gentleman
<i>I</i> was engaged to to take <i>me</i> to dances," she said.</p>

<p>"But Archie didn't say 'engaged.' Just after somebody,
I should say&mdash;and don't I just vish her joy!"</p>

<p>"It's evidently nobody at the School," mused Kitty
Windus. "Archie was almost certain about that."</p>

<p>"Vell, it isn't <i>me</i>, if you're thinking of suspecting me!"
said Miss Levey merrily. "<i>I</i> vouldn't touch him with the
end of a long pole."</p>

<p>"Chance is a fine thing, my dear," remarked Miss Windus.</p>

<p>"Opportunity's another." (This reply, Louie had
noted, was <i>de rigueur</i>.)</p>

<p>"I expect she types or something at his place in the
City."</p>

<p>"She might be in an A.B.C. shop&mdash;no, a Lockhart's."</p>

<p>"Or a barmaid," Kitty hinted.</p>

<p>"Or his vashervoman."</p>

<p>"Oh, I expect he washes his own shirts."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he'll vash her blouses, too, whoever she is."</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>Louie, her mask once more a little out of place, turned
suddenly away.</p>

<p>Little as she had been inclined to work, she was now,
somehow or other, not much more inclined for amusement.
She wandered into the shorthand dictation class, but in a
few minutes came out again. Then she walked into the
lecture-room, where some example or other had been left
chalked up on the big blackboard from the last lesson.
Thence she went into the typewriting-room, and back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the lecture-room again. Finally she got from the "library"&mdash;the
little back room where the files and presses
and gelatine copiers and a few books were kept&mdash;a number
of old examination papers, and, finding a chair near the
folding door that divided the lecture-room from the general-room,
sat down and began to turn them over.</p>

<p>But she thought more of the conversation she had just
overheard than she did of the examination papers. It had
meant, as far as she had been able to make it out, that Mr.
Jeffries had told young Merridew that he was engaged,
or hoped to be engaged, to somebody outside the school
altogether. That sounded&mdash;odd. Of course if Mr. Jeffries
said so, Mr. Jeffries ought to know; but it is a difficult
matter to disbelieve your own eyes. She supposed
she had no choice but to disbelieve them, but&mdash;but&mdash;there
<i>were</i> those two glances he had given at the Polly Ross girl&mdash;whom,
by the way, she must learn to call by her proper
name, Miss Evie Soames.</p>

<p>Louie was perfectly certain that she had not been mistaken
in the nature of those two glances. Her reason for
certitude was quite unassailable. She had known what
they meant for the simple reason that she had never received
such looks from a man herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly she dropped this mask of fevered amusement
entirely. As she had once sat on the stile between Rainham
Parva and the sea, so Louie now sat by the folding
door&mdash;relaxed, thinking of nothing, or, if of anything,
certainly neither of her late resolute pose nor yet of study.
Her mind was what she had determined it should not be if
she could help it&mdash;an empty chamber for unknown devils
to enter.</p>

<p>Students passed and repassed. Weston had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
through several times, and twice Evie Soames had come
and gone again. This so-much-talked-of Mr. Jeffries went
into the library for a book and walked past with it again.
He still wore that concealing ulster; the Soames girl had
on a brown tailor-made and a cap of knitted white wool.
Louie was hardly conscious that she noticed these things.
She still sat, all slack and unbraced, with the examination
papers on her knee.</p>

<p>All at once she came to herself. Why she should do so
at that particular moment she did not know, but, doing so,
she found herself completely awake again. To all intents
and purposes she had come out of one of those naps which,
lasting perhaps only a minute, have all the effect of a
refreshing sleep. She could reassume her mask now.
Evie Soames was talking to Weston by the blackboard; opposite
her, a pale student called Richardson was copying
down an exercise from a sheet on the wall; and she supposed
Mr. Jeffries would be bringing his book back presently.
Louie was as alive to her surroundings now as
she had been oblivious to them a few moments before.</p>

<p>A minute later Mr. Jeffries, returning with his book,
passed into the library. A few seconds later still Evie
Soames had left Mr. Weston and had followed him.</p>

<p>"Now," thought Louie, "for a little more amusement."</p>

<p>The library had only one communicating door; its other
door led only to a small room called the old ledger-room, a
dusty cubby-hole, seldom entered, that had no outlet save
the small pivoted window, high up, that gave on the head
of the stairs. Mr. Jeffries and Miss Soames would have
to come out by the same way they had entered, and Louie
rather wanted to see them come out. It was no business
of hers, but she had remembered those two glances and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
conversation between Kitty Windus and Miriam Levey,
and she had a perfect right to sit by the folding door and to
use her eyes if she wished. She was now almost preternaturally
awake. No jot of the jest, whatever it was,
should escape her.</p>

<p>Evie came out first, after four or five minutes; but
Louie was not interested in Evie. She was merely a dull
tale: Louie wanted to see him.</p>

<p>Then, a moment later, he came.</p>

<p>But no amusement came with him. Instead, Louie
knew not what sudden private ache stirred deep at her own
heart. It was not a question of those two furtive, possessive
glances now. Unmistakable enough those had been;
you do not mistake the kind of glance for which you yourself
have hungered when you see it given to another; but
not only had Louie never seen&mdash;she had never, not even in
her own rapt dreamings as a half-grown girl in her teens,
thought it possible that a man's look at a woman could
change his face as this man's face was changed now. It
was irradiated, transfigured. He took no pains now to
hide it. He could see clear down the room before him&mdash;could
see (or so he evidently thought) any who saw
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And since he did not see Louie by the folding door,
Louie knew that in his former passings and repassings he
could not have seen her either.</p>

<p>He disappeared. The Soames girl was waiting by the
door, evidently for him. No doubt he was going to see her
home. Probably she would have preferred the other, the
little cad with the red waistcoat, but she had the lion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He returned, with his hat on, and they left together.</p>

<p>But what had brought that sudden ache into Louie's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
breast? Mr. Jeffries was nothing to her. If his face
shone, Louie's heart need not therefore ache. What ailed
her?</p>

<p>Unmasked, as alive to things within herself now as she
had just been to things outside herself, she sat, deeply
wondering.</p>

<p>Against the wall at her left hand there stood a tall stationery
cupboard. It had glazed doors, and the pale student
called Richardson, coming up a moment ago to put his
exercise-book back into its place, had left one of the doors
open. The door moved on its hinges back into its place.
With its motion there swung slowly into Louie's view the
reflection of the grimy chandelier with its three naked gas-jets.</p>

<p>Was it this that reminded her of the night when
she had swept out of Mrs. Lovenant-Smith's French window
with the yellow-shaded standard lamp mirrored in its
pane?</p>

<p>It had been on that night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes closed, as if closed eyes could have
shut out a mental picture. Her lips trembled&mdash;voicelessly
they shaped a name.</p>

<p>It was the name of Roy.</p>

<p class="p2">Hitherto she had hardly known what her feelings towards
Roy really were. It had been in order to avoid asking
herself that question, among others, that she had
amused herself with Kitty Windus and welcomed the buffooneries
of Mr. Mackie. But it presented itself to her
startlingly now. Her own complete ignorance had just revealed
a shining thing to her, the beautiful thing that
had transformed Mr. Jeffries' face; now&mdash;handy-dandy&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
very transformation threw her brutally back on her
ignorance again.</p>

<p>She had thought she had sounded a mystery; had she,
after all, <i>not</i> sounded any mystery, and was she to pay in
labour and pain for nothing?</p>

<p>Her thoughts had flown back; they remained where they
had flown. Good gracious! What an escapade! Without
mercy for herself she examined it. What had really
happened? Anything worth what it was about to
cost?</p>

<p>The radiant look of another man at another woman answered
her: No.</p>

<p>She had courted him&mdash;what a conquest! She had made
him say she was pretty&mdash;what a victory! She had
schemed, planned, ensured her kisses&mdash;what a triumph!...
Why, she now asked herself for the first time, had
she wanted to triumph? Why had she not seen sooner that
what she had really wanted had been to be triumphed over?
Triumph?&mdash;It came to her with a strange newness that
women didn't triumph by triumphing. That man with
the back like the church door, for example, who had just
gone out with that pretty snippet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Instantly, and with extraordinary resilience, her mind
established a contrast.</p>

<p>No woman would have to cajole this shabby, lion-eyed
man into admiration of her beauty. Rather she would
have to save herself from his onslaught&mdash;and then, in her
very flying, she would triumph. Louie had found a fool
invincible; but this other, when he loved, would go down
with the vehemence of his own assault. When Louie had
refused to kiss Roy at their parting she had not known
exactly why she had done so: she had obeyed an instinct;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
a chapter had been closed, and had had to be marked as
definitely closed; her heart had known no rancour against
him. But now!&mdash;she might just as well have kissed him.
Now, in this strange place, two strange people&mdash;or rather
one, for the girl mattered nothing&mdash;had in a moment, and
infinitely, enlarged her sense of what, at any rate to a man,
love might mean. In the light of that enlargement any
kiss she could have given to Roy would have meant nothing&mdash;nothing,
nothing. Poor Roy, whom she had had to woo!
This other would do his own wooing. Why, he was doing
it now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then a startling recollection caused Louie to sit suddenly
upright. This lion, who had given those looks at
that girl&mdash;this shabby giant, whose face she had just seen
enheavened out of all knowledge&mdash;had told young Merridew,
who had told Kitty Windus and Miriam Levey, that
his heart was set on somebody outside this poky little Business
School altogether!</p>

<p>Involuntarily Louie drew a long breath of amazement.</p>

<p>He had told them that!</p>

<p>Then Louie became matter-of-fact. There was one thing
and one thing only to be said. If Mr. Jeffries had told
him that, Mr. Jeffries had&mdash;lied.</p>

<p>She turned it over again&mdash;she found no flaw in it.</p>

<p>Yes, if he had said that, he had lied.</p>

<p>Louie pondered. The result of her pondering was that
she said slowly to herself: "Ah&mdash;this is going to be more
than amusing&mdash;unless I'm mistaken it might even become
dramatic."</p>

<p>Up to the moment of this astonishing discovery&mdash;for
Louie knew that she had made a discovery&mdash;Mr. Jeffries
had been to her a phenomenon, different from Mr. Mackie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and Kitty Windus, but not to be observed very differently;
now in a twink she placed him in quite another category.
Or, if she still lacked a category in which to place him,
she certainly removed him for ever from the other. He
had called suddenly on her profounder attention, and, as
if he had struck upon a rock, the waters of it gushed forth.
Apparently to others he was a butt, a jest, a pathetic figure;
he was not that to Louie Causton now. They had said,
Kitty and the Jewess, that Evie Soames and the red-waistcoated
boy, off to Guildford together to-morrow, would
before long be engaged to be married; but Mr. Jeffries, the
third person in the commonest of dramas, and Mr. Jeffries,
the introducer into that drama of a preposterous, impossible
fourth actor, whose name Miriam Levey was resolved
to know, were not one and the same man. Louie sat astounded
again at his lie. It struck her as really in its
way stupendous. Others thought he was below his fellows
in this shabby little hutch of a Business School; not
so Louie now! She saw those clear yellow eyes again.
Ruses and machinations lived in them. A butt, with his
brown-paper parcel? A pathetic figure, with his cadged
baths? No&mdash;good gracious, no! The faces of butts and
pathetic figures were rather less capable of irradiation.
This man's kind made great somethings&mdash;great men, great
saints, great lovers&mdash;if it came to the worst great criminals.
Had she, Louie, been that jaunty young man in the red
waistcoat, she would have chosen for a rival and enemy
anybody she had ever seen rather than this needy, gigantic
Mr. Jeffries, who made this barefaced attempt to throw
dust into people's eyes by means of apocryphal women he
was "after" elsewhere.</p>

<p>And he helped this youngster he must hate with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
studies&mdash;cadged on his probably-to-be-successful rival for
a bath.</p>

<p>He was masked too, then.</p>

<p>Yes, at this dingy School in Holborn Louie had found
something even more interesting than amusement.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">IV</p>

<p class="center b1">§<i>a</i></p>

<p>Louie had not yet allowed herself much time for fear
of what was to happen to herself physically; she had
amused herself too heartily. She bought chocolates and
hated the smell of tobacco; and so far that was all. What
hung over her was as inevitable as Death, and for that reason
was, like Death, to be kept at arm's-length as long as
possible.</p>

<p>But she had already seen enough of Richenda's sister
to be aware that in all probability her stay in Sutherland
Place would not be a long one. Mrs. Leggat was formally
kind, to Lord Moone's niece rather than to herself; but for
the rest an armed neutrality seemed to exist between the
two women. The Leggats were childless, and for that
reason the less likely to be charitable. Louie had, in fact,
found the social layer that is bounded on the one hand by
the wickedness of pugilists and on the other by the scapes
of young gentlemen about to enter the army. Within
these limits Virtue reigned&mdash;not always harshly, always
consciously. Not the wives of the Cæsars (it seemed to
Louie) were above suspicion, but the Mrs. Leggats; not
the saints, who confessed that they were tempted, but the
Westons, who did not know of temptation's existence. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
was as if some unseen, august Mrs. Lovenant-Smith had
decreed that landladies and teachers in business schools
did not do these things. And they did not.</p>

<p>Louie went to the house of Richenda's father, the bookseller&mdash;once.
She had no wish to go again. As Richenda
had described him there had been something tragic about
him; to Louie he had appeared merely as a grey-bearded,
rheumatic, complaining old man, a picture of pathos without
dignity. And those six other Richendas, of various
ages, struck her as horribly superfluous. She wanted
Life's colour, not its greyness; she greatly preferred the
garnish, incredible Mackie.</p>

<p>The weeks passed. Weston came regularly on Sunday
mornings, and on Sunday afternoons she took long walks.
On the nights when there was no class she rode on buses,
along Oxford Street, down Regent Street to the Circus,
and back by Park Lane to the Marble Arch and Notting
Hill Gate again; or sometimes she went Paddington way,
up the Harrow Road and out and back through Kilburn.
She began to know something of the streets of London.
Her health was far better in London than it had been at
Rainham Parva. It was perfect. She still feared nothing.</p>

<p class="p2">The Christmas Examinations drew within sight, and
hand in hand with the preparation for them another and a
more lightsome preoccupation engaged the School. This
was the Christmas Social with which the last term of the
year always closed. An Executive had been formed; on it
Louie's name appeared; and it met frequently at the close
of afternoon school. One of the younger students was sent
across to the teashop over the way for scones and cake; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
kettle was set on the general-room fire; and the social was
discussed over tea.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackie was the life and soul of these meetings. He
was especially strong on the subject of whether evening-dress
was to be obligatory, permissible or debarred. He
declared himself at one of the earlier meetings as out and
out for fancy dress, but was outvoted.</p>

<p>"See me as a Woodbine, girls, beg pardon, miss-cue, a
Columbine, I mean, nearly cold with the kilt, kilt with the
cold, I should say, sixpence in the box for the opera-glasses,
Gerald, but don't ogle me while mother's in the wings,
wishing she was twenty-one again&mdash;good old mother&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"'Here's to the happiest hours of my life,<br />
Spent in the arms of another man's wife&mdash;<br />
<span class="i10">My Mo-the-rr!'"</span>
</p></div>

<p>(The shake on the long note produced by a rapid play of
Mr. Mackie's fingers on Mr. Mackie's Adam's apple.)
"Thought I'd have to backpedal, didn't you, Miss Causton?
Nay, fear not, fair damsel, the intentions of Ferdinando
are honourable, as long as you watch him, pip-pip,
phee-ooo!" (The shrill whistle behind the handkerchief
closed the strophe.)</p>

<p>But this was rushing matters. Kitty Windus spoke,
no doubt on behalf of the students who hadn't a pound a
week on their own.</p>

<p>"Fancy dress would keep a good many away," she said.
"I should love it, but it really is an expense, you know."</p>

<p>"Weston can buy a penny bottle of gum and come as a
foreign stamp."</p>

<p>"Do be serious, Mr. Mackie, now! We want the social
to be for everybody here&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>And</i> their friends," Miss Levey interpolated, with a
look of private understanding at Kitty Windus. There
was a short interlude between the two women.</p>

<p>"You <i>won't</i> find out, Miriam!"</p>

<p>"I <i>vill</i>!"</p>

<p>"Did you offer him tickets for the Holborn?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he vouldn't buy them."</p>

<p>"Doesn't Mrs. J. as-is-to-be dance?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He vouldn't buy the tickets."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you another half-crown you don't get him there,
let alone her!"</p>

<p>"Done vith you, Kitty Vindus!" cried Miss Levey excitedly.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Mackie interposed. "Who's that? Jeffries?
He can come in his ulster as Boaz&mdash;<i>heu</i>, how Ruthless!
(Beshrew me, but have I not a pretty wit?)"</p>

<p>"He's got that new brown suit to come in&mdash;or did he get
it second-hand, Archie?" asked Kitty.</p>

<p>"New," quoth Archie authoritatively. "Allworthy's,
in Cheapside. Two ten."</p>

<p>"I nearly died when he turned up without that old
ulster!"</p>

<p>"Vasn't it screaming?" simpered Miss Levey. "No,
don't, Archie!" (Young Merridew was pulling out the
frill of her jabot.)</p>

<p>"Do tell us exactly what he said when you congratulated
him on his engagement, Evie!" said Kitty Windus,
turning to Evie Soames.</p>

<p>The girl coloured a little. In common fairness Louie
had to acquit her of full participation in the joke of Mr.
Jeffries and his unknown <i>fiancée</i>. Louie had learned that
it had been in order to congratulate Mr. Jeffries on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
supposed engagement that she had followed Mr. Jeffries
into the library on that Friday evening before her departure
for the week-end to Guildford. She thought little
more of her on that account. In being too ready with
apologies and congratulations Evie Soames merely showed
the vulgarity of the rest of the place.</p>

<p>"No, do let's get on with business," Kitty Windus broke
in. "I vote for ordinary dress."</p>

<p>"Yes, ordinary dress," came the chorus.</p>

<p>"Vith vite gloves, of course," said Miss Levey.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Vot do you say, Miss Causton?"</p>

<p>"White gloves, of course," said Louie, with her demurest
look. "And flowers in their buttonholes."</p>

<p>"Some gentlemen don't like to vear flowers," said
Miriam Levey suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Aha, doesn't he?" from Mr. Mackie. "<i>I</i> saw you
at the Holborn, Miss Levey&mdash;naughty, naughty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean very big ones," said Louie, sipping
her tea.</p>

<p>And the discussion went on, and meeting followed meeting;
but the examination was to take place before the social.</p>

<p>The only fear Louie had for her Elementary was whether
it would be worth very much when she had got it. She
supposed that as an earnest preparation for the struggle
of life this place was not quite such a fraud as Chesson's,
but that struggle could hardly be as fierce as Richenda
Earle had said if this Elementary took her very far. Indeed
she had wondered more than once lately, especially
since she had ceased to amuse herself quite so desperately,
whether it was likely that typewriting and book-keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
were to be her destiny after all. She supposed they were,
but she couldn't quite realise it. But she was fully prepared,
and hoped Mr. Jeffries was as sure of his Honours
paper as she was of her simple Pass.</p>

<p>For she had gathered that success in the coming examination
was of importance to Mr. Jeffries. She did not
know the nature of his studies; later she surmised that
those had been only loosely linked to the ordinary school
curriculum, and that while for his Certificate's sake he
must acquire all that text-books could tell him, his real
broodings had been over matters that are antecedent to
text-books. That was probably the difference between him
and Mr. Weston. Mr. Weston was said to be clever, but
his cleverness ended at the point where real inquiry began.
More than this Louie did not know. You cannot, after
all, ask the pioneer what he goes forth for to see. He
goes forth to see whatever there may be to be seen.</p>

<p>The weeks that had intervened since that evening when
Louie had seen that wonderful radiance of his face had
done nothing to alter her conviction that if there was a
dark horse in that Holborn stable at all the name of that
horse was Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>As it happened, Mr. Jeffries was almost the first person
she encountered when, on the Friday morning of the examination,
she entered the School at half-past ten. He
wore the new brown suit that had been remarked on at the
meetings of the Executive of the social, and he was looking
with curiosity about him. They had made quite extensive
preparations for the examination. The whole place had
been divided into compartments with hired yellow-painted
screens, and screens also barricaded the <span class="blocke">E</span> of reference-books
near the bay window of the general-room. New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
pens and new blotting-paper lay on the desks, and the
little porcelain inkwells had been newly filled. Then it
occurred to Louie that it was more than likely that Mr.
Jeffries had never been in the place in the daytime before.
He must have got the day off from that "somewhere in
the City" that Kitty Windus had said sounded so prosperous.
His tawny hair was as flat and silky as ever, and his
chin as cleanly shaved. He passed her with a curt bow and
continued his inspection of the place. The candidates
stood talking in groups, waiting for eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>"Have you discovered your&mdash;er&mdash;appointed place, Miss
Causton?" said Weston, coming up to Louie. "Good,
good! I must now take my departure. Members of the
Staff are not permitted to remain on the premises during
the hours devoted to the examination. I wish you&mdash;er&mdash;good
luck."</p>

<p>He seemed to change his mind about saying "a happy
issue from all your afflictions."</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock Louie was seated in her little screen-enclosed
compartment. A sort of hired mourner read a
formal caution to the candidates. She noticed that it
lacked the <i>largior ether</i> of the third person indicative, being,
indeed, in the second person imperative; and then she
drew her paper to her.</p>

<p>Quiet fell on the examination-rooms.</p>

<p>She found her papers no more difficult than she had
anticipated. On one point only, a matter of indenting in
actual practice, was she a little in doubt, and a minute in
the old ledger-room at lunch-time would tell her whether
her answer had been right or wrong. She read over again
what she had written; it seemed, with the possible exception
of that single point, all right; and she tilted her chair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
put her hands behind her head, and leaned back. The
candidates had been warned that they must bring lunch
with them. It was half-an-hour from lunch-time yet.</p>

<p>Her place was by the folding door of the general-room.
From it she could see nothing save the stationery cupboard
on her left, and, beyond it, the next screen-enclosed compartment.
She was wondering who was in it when a foot
moved beneath the yellow screen. It was the foot of Mr.
Jeffries. Louie hoped that he was getting on well, and
then dismissed him from her thoughts. She began to wonder
about the practical usefulness of the examination
again.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was well enough in its way, but less than
ever could she persuade herself that this kind of thing was
to be her destiny. There were too many other likelihoods&mdash;not
to speak of the one certainly so huge that she had
sometimes been actually in danger of leaving it out of
the account altogether. Idly she counted them. First,
there was the certainty.... Next, she would probably be
leaving Sutherland Place soon, to go&mdash;where? She did
not know. At the price of submission to Uncle Augustus
she could go back home; or Chaff would have her looked
after; but both these courses were rather out of the question.
They were out of the question because lately something
else had been more and more in her thoughts&mdash;her
unknown father. That father might, for all she knew,
be the bugbear her mother had always made him out to
be; but on the other hand he might not. She knew her
mother, and the more she thought of it the more she gave
her father the benefit of an increasing number of doubts.
Until she should have seen him it was now no more than
fair that she should do so. Moreover, she could see him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
at any time without his being any the wiser of the&mdash;inspection.
Chaff knew where he was; Chaff, who was
always fetching or taking her somewhere, would take her
there also. She was resolved to go sooner or later, and
later might be&mdash;who knew?&mdash;too late.</p>

<p>For at last she had admitted a dread.</p>

<p>In any case, her destiny was quite as likely to be determined
by a visit to that public-house up the Thames as
by writing, in this stuffy Holborn third floor, answers to
ridiculous questions about <i>pro forma</i> invoices and bills of
lading.</p>

<p>She was still turning these things over in her mind when
the bell rang for the close of the first part of the examination.</p>

<p>She ate her lunch in the company of Kitty Windus and
Miss Levey, and then the three women passed out on to the
staircase and sat down half-way down the stairs. But the
men had flocked to the staircase for their noxious smoking,
and Louie re-entered the general-room again. Then
she remembered the doubtful point in her paper and walked
to the library. She passed through it into the old ledger-room.
Any old ledger would settle the point on which
she was not quite sure.</p>

<p>The room was almost dark, but Louie knew where the
musty old books were. She put out her hand to the nearest
of them. But suddenly she withdrew her hand. The
high window that gave on the head of the stairs afforded
no more than a glimmer of light, but Louie thought she
had seen something move. She peered into the twilight,
"Is anybody there?" she said, but she had no answer.</p>

<p>But the room was occupied. The next moment she had
seen and fled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>Her irregular lips were pursed as she came out into the
light again. There was a confusion, too, in her eyes,
probably as much as there had been in the eyes of the two
she had come upon in there. They must have seen her
come in, and have realised that their only chance of escaping
detection lay in keeping perfectly still.</p>

<p>Polly Ross, cheek to cheek with that horrid little bounder!</p>

<p>There was no question now of whom the girl preferred.</p>

<p>Louie, wondering what right she had to do so, felt
nevertheless a little sick.</p>

<p>But the next moment her fastidiousness had vanished.
The door that led to the stairs had opened; Mr. Mackie's
voice sounded loud for a moment on the landing; and then
Mr. Jeffries lurched in, stumbled, and almost ran to his
compartment between the yellow screens.</p>

<p>How he too knew what was going on in the old ledger-room,
Louie could not guess; but she knew that he did
know.</p>

<p>She walked slowly to her own place and sat down.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the bell for the second half of the
examination rang, and a new paper was put before Louie.
But she neither glanced at it nor yet heard the voice of the
hired mourner repeating his caution. She sat with her
chin in her hands, looking straight before her. She was
wondering what was taking place behind the yellow screen
beyond the stationery cupboard. Amusement was hardly
the word for that.</p>

<p>For she had seen Mr. Jeffries' face as he had stumbled
in. She sought words for the expression that had been
upon it. Lost&mdash;despairing&mdash;devilish&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>There was not much doubt about who <i>he</i> was in love
with either.</p>

<p>Devilish, despairing, lost&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor&mdash;soul!" she thought compassionately....</p>

<p>She wondered why she should be so unaccountably nervous.
She was nervous. She even jumped a little when
somebody on the other side of the folding door allowed
a pen to fall to the floor. She could see the feet beneath
the lower edge of the screen in front of her; they did not
move; the examination quietness had fallen on the place
again, and the very quietness grew on her. Strong drama,
if not tragedy outright, was being enacted behind those
half-inch yellow boards beyond the stationery cupboard,
but the quietness continued. It was such a quietness as
she had read of in tales when, somebody's ears being sharpened
for an expected scream, their eyes had not at first
noticed the little dark rivulet of blood trickling slowly
across the floor. Involuntarily her eyes went to the yellow
screen.</p>

<p>But rubbish; this was morbid.</p>

<p>Morbid or not, however, her lips almost shaped the
words, slowly and deliberately: that boy with the red waistcoat
would do well to be careful. He would do especially
well to be careful if, after this, after the glare on the
other's face, he should still have help offered him with his
studies or be asked for a bath. For something would happen
then. Eggshells such as he did not come into collision
with bronze without something happening. And if anything
not easily to be accounted for did happen to that
odious little whippersnapper, nothing would ever persuade
Louie that she did not know a likely quarter in which to
look for the reason.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>Blind, devilish despair!</p>

<p>And all for an empty-headed little thing who could have
been found in her dozens behind twenty shop counters not
a quarter of a mile away! What on earth, what on, or
under, or above the earth, could this brooding, clever,
gigantic, laughed-at creature want with such a doll? Why
could he not leave her in her proper place&mdash;cheek by cheek
with the little bounder of her choice in that smelly, unlighted
old ledger-room? The man must be blind, or a
fool.</p>

<p>Then a sort of lethargy took Louie. Suddenly she cared
for nothing. Let the fancy-stationer's cub take his risks;
let the other eat his heart out if he would; it was no business
of hers. Nor was that absurd table of questions before
her any business of hers. Kitty Windus might answer
that sort of thing; Mackie might answer it; but the
Scarisbricks were not Kittys, with her "part-independency,"
not Mackies, to stuff their heads and ink their fingers
like this for their "permanencies." She did not know
now why she had ever come to the place, and she wanted
no more of it. What she was going to do she did not
know. She did know, however, that she was not going to
answer that silly paper.</p>

<p>So, by-and-by, she allowed the paper to be collected
again, as blank as when it had been placed before
her.</p>

<p>She came upon the perverse Mr. Jeffries once more
before she left. He almost ran her down bodily as they
met in the doorway of the typewriting-room. But this
time she did not look at his face. With a swift intaking
of her breath she fell back to save herself. She did not
hear whether he apologised or not; in one moment, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
premeditation, her whole being had become constrained
to a new, protective, instinctive attitude.</p>

<p>Slowly and thoughtfully she left the School.</p>

<p>She alone of the students was unsurprised to hear, four
or five days later, that Mr. Jeffries, who had passed with
distinction in the first part of his paper, had, like herself,
failed in the second part.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">§<i>b</i></p>

<p>For the examination the rooms had been cut up with
screens; for the breaking-up social they were cleared of
everything that could be stowed away into dark corners.
Never was such a hoisting and calling as those with which
the hired piano was got up the three flights of stairs.
Most of it came from Mr. Mackie, turned for the nonce into
a shabash-wallah.</p>

<p>"Mind her funnybone&mdash;all together&mdash;up with her! Oh,
pursue me, wenches, I've got my muscle up, first time
since the second housemaid ran away with the dustman!
Don't tickle her parson's nose, Archi-bald, or she'll sneeze
when I sing, key in the usual place&mdash;and mind the stair
above the top, it isn't there. This way&mdash;excuse my shirt-sleeves,
Miss Windus, I'm in mourning."</p>

<p>And so the piano was trundled to its place in the corner
by the big blackboard.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackie was of service, too, in the French-chalking
of the floor, for the men hauled him about by the arms and
legs on a piece of sacking in order to give it its final polish
for dancing. Half the students, male and female, helped
to wind the blackened old brackets and chandeliers with
red and green tissue paper, to set evergreens on the tops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of the cupboards, and to affix the trophies of little Christmas
tree flags on the cabbagey old walls; and Louie helped
with the refreshments. Three women had been got in,
one to make coffee and the others to preside in the cloakrooms,
and Miss Levey had won half-a-crown from Kitty
Windus.</p>

<p>For Mr. Jeffries was coming to the party after all.
More, it had been Louie herself who had asked him, though
it had been Miss Levey's cunning that had made her do so.
On no grounds at all save that it appeared to annoy, the
Jewess had once or twice twitted Louie that Mr. Jeffries
favoured <i>her</i> and, when Mr. Jeffries had declined her own
invitation, had nudged Louie. "<i>You</i> ask him, and see
whether he doesn't come!" the nudge had meant. Louie
entered into no contest with Miss Levey. She had turned
at once to Mr. Jeffries and repeated the invitation. He
had accepted it.</p>

<p>Louie doubted her own wisdom in going to that social
at all. Even when she had reached Sutherland Place and
spread out her frocks on her bed she still doubted. But
suddenly she gave a short laugh. Of course she was
going! It was her first "social," and it might be her last;
she was going, and she was going to wear the oyster-grey
satin that, ever since she had had it, had always seemed to
"live" so on her shoulders.</p>

<p>She declined Mrs. Leggat's help in getting into it; if
Mrs. Leggat would be so good as to get her a hansom instead&mdash;&mdash;Mrs.
Leggat went out. The oyster-grey was
one of the oldest of her frocks; Louie knew every stitch of
it; and she smiled as she thought that for that very reason
she would have chosen it had she deliberately intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
to make a conquest. She surveyed herself in it in the
tilted glass. Yes, she thought she would do.</p>

<p>"It's your last time on, poor old rag," she muttered.</p>

<p>She heard the pulling up of the hansom; she put on a
light shawl and descended; and Mrs. Leggat lingered in
the doorway as she drove off.</p>

<p>They had set candles on the floors of the landings of
the Holborn stairs, but they guttered in the draughts, and
showed little but the feet of those who ascended. Louie
followed a pair of orange silk-stockinged ankles and a
trammel of orange petticoats (she didn't know whose) up
the stairs, and entered the general-room. The library
had been converted into a ladies' cloakroom, with the old
ledger-room as an annexe; and in this last room Evie
Soames, with an elaborate running of pink ribbons beneath
the openwork of her cream net blouse, was putting on her
slippers. She only showed Louie the top of her dark head;
in this and other ways she had displayed reserve since the
lunch interval of the examination day. A woman with a
pair of very chapped hands and a very clean apron took
Louie's shawl; and Louie, first glancing at her hair over
the powdered shoulders of the person in orange, went
into the double room that had been prepared for dancing.</p>

<p>Students and their friends had turned up in their best
bibs and tuckers. Most of the men wore swallow-tailed
coats; one of the exceptions was Mr. Jeffries in his brown
jacket-suit. He was talking to Miss Levey, or rather Miss
Levey was gasping to him; she had just given him, or
rather hung upon his wrist, one of the violet-written cards,
printed from the gelatine-copier, which served as programmes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Weston wore a tightly fitting old frock-coat,
which Mr. Mackie humorously likened to the overcoat of
sausage that had spent the night in the coal-hole. Archie
Merridew had a white waistcoat. All the men stroked the
wrinkles out of their white gloves without ceasing. The
women, to the reflective eye, had lost little by the foregoing
of out-and-out evening-dress. There was an "I could an'
if I would" about their long sleeves and high necks. Kitty
Windus, in her blue foulard, with a cutlet-frill about her
thin neck, graciously consented to the level of those who
had not a pound a week on their own; Miriam Levey,
in a maroon pinafore-frock with broad braces over her
shoulders, instantly put every simple blouse in the room
at its ease. One frock only flouted the modest agreement
to which the executive had come; this was the orange
satin one which Louie had followed upstairs. It partially
clothed a friend of Mr. Mackie's. Louie heard the words
in which Mr. Mackie introduced young Merridew to its
wearer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merridew, Miss Dulcie Levine, Miss Levine, Mr.
Merridew, two of the best, seasonable weather for the time
of the year, ain't it, what? Permit me, Dulcibella, a bit
of fluff" (here Mr. Mackie cast aside the bit of fluff, if
there was one, which he had taken from Miss Dulcie's
shoulder, and represented the noise of its falling by a loud
stamp on the floor). "Ought to be dancing soon; what
time is it by your clocks, Dulcie? <i>I</i> saw them as you got
out of the Black Maria, the cab, I mean&mdash;<i>heu</i>, desist, Mr.
Mackie, you wag!" (Mr. Mackie smacked his own wrist
in reproof of himself.) "Why am I not in me usual
spirits, gin cold, to-night, Dulcinea? 'Tis thy fatal beauty
has undone me; what ho, a needle and threat, O fairest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
thy socks, sex I should say.... Ay, she dances, Archibald,
but not with thee, base varlet; she dances at the
Theatre hight Alcazar, nigh unto ye Square called Leicester."</p>

<p>Louie heard Kitty Windus whisper to Evie Soames that
Mr. Mackie was going to be splendid to-night; but her
approval did not extend to Mr. Mackie's friend, who was
already too splendid. Kitty's head was held so high when
Miss Levine passed that she appeared to be looking at her
with her nostrils. With her eyes she saw only the orange
creature's back. This was a rather handsome <span class="blocke">V</span>, and that
did not improve matters. Kitty whispered behind her
fan about "some people." Miss Dulcie used Kitty as a
quizzing-glass for the inspection of whoever happened to
be behind her.</p>

<p>Mr. Jeffries stood with his back against the thrown-back
folding door. He did not dance, but he had not at all the
air of a wet blanket; on the contrary, his face wore a quite
lively smile. He was smiling at the red and green tissue
paper that enswathed the central chandelier. Louie saw
Evie Soames pass him; his eyes rested on her for a moment,
but only as they rested on everybody else, and then
went back to the red and green tissue paper of the chandelier
again. He had accepted the inevitable, then. Indeed,
had he not done so, Louie could hardly imagine that
he would have been there. Well, it was the most sensible
thing he could do. Louie would go and speak to him presently.</p>

<p>Louie made a tour of the rooms. The <span class="blocke">E</span> of reference-books
had been turned into a place for sitting out, and in
the typewriting-room the lids of two or three desks had
been wedged up to form card-tables. Into the room beyond,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
which was the smoking-room, she did not penetrate.
Already a fiddle was tuning up, but Louie had told
young Merridew, who had magnanimously asked her for
her card, that she did not intend to dance. None the less
he had taken her card and scrawled something on it. She
had tossed the piece of violet-written pasteboard into a
corner.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock there was a tapping on the top of the
piano, and the music began. Mr. Mackie and the lady in
orange glided out over the French-chalked floor. Two
minutes later the room was full of waltzing couples.</p>

<p>Louie had sat down on the opposite side of the room to
Mr. Jeffries. Through momentarily clear spaces she saw
him from time to time. He did not move from his station
by the folding door, where, among the hoppers and
caperers who sped past him, he seemed to have something
of the stability of a monument in some centre of apparently
aimless traffic. Still, he seemed to be enjoying
himself, and Louie intended to go across to him when the
waltz was over.</p>

<p>A word she overheard, however, caused her to change
her mind and to rise to her feet at once. Mr. Mackie,
passing with his orange partner, had repeated his jape
about the Ruthless Boaz.</p>

<p>Without more ado Louie threaded her way through the
dancers and stood before Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>"Won't you try to dance?" she said.</p>

<p>As he turned the amber eyes on her she had the feeling
that she slid all at once into the field of some piece of apparatus
with an object-glass. She was the object. For
a moment he forgot his smile; he looked attentively at her;
and then the smile returned. He answered in an easy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
deep voice, the accent of which was neither Cockney nor
yet quite of the mode of the men Louie knew.</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I don't dance," he said.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me teach you?"</p>

<p>His eyes were still on hers. He seemed to give the
simple question weighty consideration. Then his eyes
dropped to his hands.</p>

<p>"Hallo," he said, as if to himself. His programme was
where Miss Levey had put it, dangling from his wrist as if
from a hook. Apparently he had not noticed it before.
Then, looking at Louie again, he said: "I mean, my
gloves&mdash;I've no gloves."</p>

<p>"Gloves!" she said quietly. "Come."</p>

<p>She took the absurd programme from his wrist, threw
it away, and put her gloved hand into his naked one.</p>

<p>She drew Mr. Jeffries into the current.</p>

<p>Louie had danced with ignoramuses before, but never
with a man quite so awkward as this. She did her best to
steer him, but before they had gone half-way round the
room they had collided with Evie Soames, leaning back in
the crook of young Merridew's arm&mdash;with Kitty Windus,
tiptoe and leaning forward over her partner&mdash;with Mr.
Mackie, who had lighted a cigarette and was singing the
refrain of the dance as he passed. Then Mr. Jeffries
begged her, out of consideration for herself, to stop. But
she had no desire to stop. She wondered why, bumped
and trampled so, she should want to go on, but she gave that
riddle up. He did not cease to apologise for his ungainliness.</p>

<p>But the riddle of why she did not wish to stop refused
to be given up. It renewed itself with each of his
apologies. Stumbling ludicrously, she knew that she still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
wished to go on. What she did not know at that time of
her life was that she had secrets that hitherto she had
kept even from herself.</p>

<p>Then, all in a moment, the strange thing happened.
She felt that colour, that stress and anger never brought
there, rise slow and warm into her cheeks. Her glance had
merely rested for a moment on that hand of hers that lay
slender as a willow leaf in his, but the riddle was a
puzzle no longer. Abashed, she <i>had</i> surprised a secret.</p>

<p>She had caught herself wishing&mdash;half wishing&mdash;she
did not quite know what&mdash;that she too had taken off her
glove.</p>

<p>Her colour lasted for half-a-minute; then, perhaps because
of the colour, her voice became matter-of-fact. She
glanced up at him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you failed in your examination," she said.</p>

<p>Louie was tall, but his head was clear and away above
hers. He looked down, earnest, anxious, smiling, all
three.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he said. "Why should it?" he
added.</p>

<p>Louie had thought that it had mattered a great deal, but
she was still a little bewildered. Even out of the answer
to the riddle another seemed to have sprung already. She
laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;only that one doesn't like to be beaten," she said.</p>

<p>This too he seemed to give profound yet (if such a thing
may be) absentminded attention.</p>

<p>"Is anybody ever beaten?" he asked slowly. "I mean,
unless they deserve to be?"</p>

<p>Archie and Evie Soames had just overtaken them again,
laughing together, as, hand in hand, they took a running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
glide towards the door. His remark came oddly from
a doubly beaten man. What then did he call a beating?...
She looked covertly at the two hands again.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;mayn't circumstances be too strong for you?"</p>

<p>This again he considered. "Circumstances are strong,"
he admitted. "But then, if one's a fool, so are a good
many other people. There's always that chance, you
see."</p>

<p>He spoke as gently as if he had been speaking to a child,
but Louie suddenly found herself wondering whether he
had accepted the inevitable after all. This hardly sounded
like it. She spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"Nobody thinks you're a fool just because you failed&mdash;at
least I don't."</p>

<p>"Failed?" he repeated, as if puzzled.... "Oh, you
mean the examination! Of course I ought never to have
gone in for it. (Oh dear, another bump&mdash;I'm afraid you
find me hopeless.)"</p>

<p>"Not have gone in for it? Why?"</p>

<p>The lion's eyes looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why? Why, because I failed." He seemed to consider
it an entirely conclusive answer.</p>

<p>"But you'll surely try again?" said Louie.</p>

<p>"Eh? 'Try,' did you say?... Oh, the men who
have to try are no good. For that matter it's always the
duffers who try the hardest. I admit they pull it off, but
then things are arranged so that the duffers can pull them
off&mdash;have to be, I suppose. But the men who aren't
duffers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"What?" she said.</p>

<p>But once more she had the feeling that she had only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
just swum into the field of his vision. It was singularly
disconcerting. His smile, which had disappeared, appeared
again. He seemed to remember that he was at a
dance.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're coming back after Christmas?" he
said.</p>

<p>It was not very likely, but she said: "Very likely.
You were saying, about the men who aren't duffers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he got her focus. "Was I? Well, there aren't
so many of them that we need bother about them. So you
are coming back?"</p>

<p>Louie found him extraordinary, unclassifiable. She
could not say that his answers were not ready; they were
instant to the point; but somehow they weren't answers.
Of course, they <i>were</i> answers if you liked, but they seemed
in some way to be private communings as well. She wondered
whether he was in the habit of talking much to
himself; he spoke rather as if he was&mdash;as if, his consciousness
of her presence notwithstanding, he considered himself
to be as good as alone now.</p>

<p>Louie had heard the expression "second self"&mdash;well,
this, "second self" or not, was certainly a curious accord.
And then he allowed that deliberate, altogether discordant
smile (that might just as well have been hooked round his
ears like a false beard) to come between, and asked her if
she was coming back after Christmas!</p>

<p>Then&mdash;this came suddenly&mdash;she knew for a certainty
what hitherto had hung in doubt&mdash;that she would not be
coming back after Christmas. She must sit down. Of
course, it was to have been expected. She had been unwise
to dance.</p>

<p>She spoke faintly. "Please take me to a seat."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>Quite automatically he did so. He led her to the <span class="blocke">E</span> of
reference-books. The waltz closed. So did Louie's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Please leave me alone for a few minutes," she murmured.</p>

<p>He bowed, and retired as automatically as he had come.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she felt better, but she still sat in the
little book-lined recess. Her eyes remained closed, but
not now altogether from faintness. She heard Mr.
Mackie's voice, apparently a long way off, shouting,
"Come on&mdash;let's get the ice broken!" and partners were
being chosen for the Shop-Girl Lancers. More minutes
passed. Louie, her eyes still closed, had begun once more
to think of that secret she had surprised within herself.</p>

<p>She doubted herself profoundly now. For all she now
knew her nature might contain other such secrets as this
that had sent the warm blood into her cheeks at a touch&mdash;nay,
at the thought of a touch. She might have, so to
speak, a basic, unsuspected layer of them, needing only to
be stirred to provide surprise after surprise. Those surprises
might make all she had hitherto known&mdash;all&mdash;seem
stupid and flat and commonplace. If so, why must the
discovery come now? Secrets from herself&mdash;now? Impossible!</p>

<p>But, as if limned on her closed lids, she saw the two
hands again, her own like a lanceolate leaf, lying within
that great masculine engine of his.</p>

<p>And all at once she felt unutterably lonely.</p>

<p>It was some time before she opened her eyes again. By
that time Mr. Mackie had succeeded in breaking the ice.
The floor shook to the fourth figure of the Shop-Girl
Lancers, and Louie saw, beyond the reference-books, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Alcazar beauty swung clear off the ground, a goldfish whirling
almost horizontally past. Miss Levey's skirts followed,
their owner crying, "Help, help!"... "<i>For
it ain't the proper way to treat a la-ady!</i>" Mr. Mackie's
jubilant voice sang&mdash;and when the figure ended there were
shouts and clapping of hands and uproarious cries of
"Again, again!"</p>

<p>By-and-by Louie rose. She walked up the room again.
At the piano Mr. Mackie, who was to sing, was now confidentially
humming the air of his song into the hired
pianist's ear. Mr. Jeffries, once more looking as if he
needed a niche and a plinth, was standing in his original
place, by the folding door. Miss Levine and Archie Merridew
were half hidden behind the piano; and Kitty
Windus, radiant, was openly flirting with the pale student
called Richardson. Evie Soames had just spoken to Mr.
Jeffries; she was sulking at Archie's desertion of her.
Then Mr. Weston announced, solemnly and distinctly, that
Mr. Mackie was about to add to the enjoyment of all present
by singing a song entitled "That Gorgonzola Cheese."
Applause greeted the announcement, and Mr. Mackie, who
had slipped behind the piano for a moment and returned
with his coat on the wrong side out, began.</p>

<p>Louie found herself once more by the side of Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>"I should like some coffee," she said.</p>

<p>The coffee was in an adjoining room. For the first
time since she had been at the School Louie did not want
to hear Mr. Mackie.</p>

<p>But the hint was lost on Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>"Eh? Certainly," he said, and went away in search of
the coffee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"'Oh&mdash;that&mdash;Gorgonzola Cheese!'"
</p></div>

<p>Mr. Mackie sang,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
"'It must have been unhealthy, I suppose,<br />
For the old Tom Cat fell dead upon the mat<br />
When the niff got up his nose!'"</p>
</div>

<p>Kitty was laughing almost hysterically.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
"'Talk about the flavour of the crackling of the pork!<br />
I guess it wasn't half so strong<br />
As the delicate effluvia that filled our house<br />
When the Gorgonzola Cheese went wrong!'"</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jeffries had returned with Louie's coffee, but
Louie barely touched it. Great stupid fellow!</p>

<p>Then he turned to her with some merely banal remark,
and Louie, giving it all the answer it deserved, turned and
left him.</p>

<p>That unspeakable loneliness had come upon her again.</p>

<p>Louie made no further attempt to talk to Mr. Jeffries.
She watched another dance, heard Mr. Weston recite "The
Raven," and then went to the cloakroom for her shawl.
There she came upon Kitty Windus, who had found it
necessary to do up her hair again.</p>

<p>"You surely aren't going?" Kitty exclaimed. She
herself was a-tremble with flirtation and happiness.
"Why, you're as bad as Mr. Jeffries! Though I will
admit that even <i>he</i> came out of his shell for once. I shall
begin to think Miriam's right soon!" She gave Louie an
arch look.</p>

<p>Louie's opinion was that Mr. Jeffries had never been
more completely concealed in his shell than he had been
that even, but "Oh, has he gone?" she said indifferently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, a few minutes ago. Isn't everything going splendidly!
Why, Mr. Mackie's a host in himself!"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Louie, passing her shawl over her head.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall see you in the morning?" said
Kitty. "Everybody's coming to help to clear away."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Louie.</p>

<p>And as the piano broke into the prelude to the waltz
cotillion she left.</p>

<p>But she did not leave that dingy Holborn third floor,
never to enter it again, without a grateful word to Mr.
Mackie. She came upon him on a landing. His trousers
were French-chalked almost to the knees with the vigour
of his dancing, and for his next song he had put on a false
nose with blue whiskers attached to it. He was making
sure that the adornment did not interfere with his whistle.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Mackie," said Louie, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackie stopped the whistle. "What, you toddling,
Miss Causton?" he said. "Why, we ain't properly
warmed up yet!"</p>

<p>"I must go. And"&mdash;she smiled almost fondly at
him&mdash;"I should like to thank you."</p>

<p>Mr. Mackie was quite conscious of desert. "Not at
all," he said. "You mean the 'Gorgonzola Cheese,' I
suppose? Went all right, didn't it? Never known that
song fail yet: it always gets 'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, for more than that. If you're ever thinking of
setting up a cure I daresay I could find you a few patients.
You're wonderful. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Say olive oil, but not good-bye&mdash;and Merry Christmas,"
said Mr. Mackie.</p>

<p>But Louie knew that it was good-bye.</p>

<h2 class="p6">PART III<br />
MORTLAKE ROAD</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p class="center b1 p2">I</p>

<p>On a sunny morning in mid-January Louie Causton
went to see, but not necessarily to be seen by, her
father. Captain Cecil Chaffinger accompanied her. As
they walked across Richmond Park they talked.</p>

<p>"You're sure the walk isn't too much for you, Mops?"
said the Captain solicitously.</p>

<p>She pressed his arm. "No, I'm ever so much better for
it."</p>

<p>"We could get a cart or something at the Star and
Garter, you know."</p>

<p>"I'd much rather walk, Chaff. We can take the train
back."</p>

<p>"All right, little Mops."</p>

<p>They walked for a few minutes in silence; then&mdash;</p>

<p>"That woman wasn't&mdash;wasn't a beast, was she?" Chaff
asked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Leggat?"</p>

<p>"If that's her name. I mean, there was no row?"</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world."</p>

<p>The Captain tugged at his moustache. "H'm! Not
like you. Ever leave anywhere without a row before,
Mops?"</p>

<p>Louie laughed a little. "Now you mention it, I don't
think I ever did," she admitted. "But there wasn't a
word said. She knew, and I knew she knew. So I
cleared out. That was all. She made me some beef-tea
before I left."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>Again they walked in silence.</p>

<p>The daintiest of hoar-frosts lay over the Park; on Putney
Heath they had passed skaters. The keen wind had
reddened the Captain's nose, and Louie could not help
smiling as he took out his handkerchief for the twentieth
time. She had remembered Mr. Mackie.</p>

<p>"Ought to have a silk one a day like this," Chaff
grunted, blowing hard. "Makes you perfectly raw....
I say, dear old Mops&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, old boy?"</p>

<p>"Anything <i>I</i> could have done, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She squeezed his arm again. "I shall be giving you
plenty to do presently. And you say he's not a bad sort."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;" said the Captain doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll take me in, and then wait outside till I've
seen for myself."</p>

<p>But at that Chaff rebelled. "Hanged if I do&mdash;dash it
all, it's a public-house! You'll find me in the parlour or
whatever it is."</p>

<p>"How old is he?"</p>

<p>"Let me see: he'll be fifty. Yes, he'll be fifty. Your
mother's fifty-four."</p>

<p>"You'll remember your promise, Chaff?"</p>

<p>"About where you are? Oh, I'll be mum as the grave.
Don't you forget yours."</p>

<p>"No. You shall come and see me."</p>

<p>The Captain sighed. His Mops was a strange being.
That fool Moone had taken the wrong way with her, but
a better way might have been found than this. Well,
Chaff would have a word or two with Mr. Buck Causton
himself.</p>

<p>They continued their walk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>When Louie had first resolved that she would seek her
father, nothing had seemed more natural. In prospect,
the thing had been simplicity itself. But it was, somehow,
less simple now. Indeed, its difficulties had increased
with every step she took. What about Buck? Must he
necessarily make her so very welcome? Suppose, when
she made her announcement, he should shake hands, ask
how her mother was, offer her tea (or whatever publicans
did offer ladies), say he had been very glad to see her, and
let her go again? How, in the face of that, could she say:
"I am your daughter; I really don't know why I have
come; I have stayed away a good long time, but here I am,
needing friends; why I need friends I will explain to your
wife." Was it not likely that Buck had had more than
enough of her family?</p>

<p>Had Chaff, as they descended to Kingston, once more
urged that she was on a wild-goose chase, as likely as not
she would have turned back at the first word.</p>

<p>They reached Buck's public-house&mdash;The Molyneux
Arms, near the corner of Kingston Bridge.</p>

<p>"Well," said Chaff, stopping, "what do we do now,
Mops?"</p>

<p>"We go in, I suppose," said Louie. Without pausing,
she moved towards the largest door (there was "Public
Bar" written upon it) of an establishment that, if it lacked
the garishness of a modern drinking-palace, was yet not
quite the red-curtained, lattice-windowed, Christmas-number
hostelry of Louie's imaginings. But Chaff, with a
"No, not there," drew her round the corner to a quieter
door, where small bay-trees stood in green tubs. The step
had a brightly polished brass sill and a thick rubber
mat perforated with the name "Molyneux Arms." Beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the little vestibule were double doors with cut-glass
panels and a diagonal brass bar on each and a piston for
automatic closing at the top.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better wait here," said Chaff.</p>

<p>"All right," said Louie, now heartily wishing she had
not left her new abode in Mortlake Road, Putney.</p>

<p>With a soft sigh of the piston, the brass-barred doors
closed behind Chaff.</p>

<p>This entrance lay in a short blind alley off the main
street, the end of which seemed to be closed by a stableyard.
Somebody over a brick wall was walking a horse over cobbles,
and a man's voice muttered, "Come up." There
was a light clashing of harness, and the same voice began
a soft but strong singing, hoisting itself to the higher notes
as if the interpolated aspirates had been so many stirrups:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
"No re-(<i>h</i>)est&mdash;but the gra-(<i>h</i>)ave<br />
For the pi-(<i>h</i>)ilgrim of Love!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
</div>

<p>Then a back door opened, and a woman's voice was heard.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, James."</p>

<p>The song ceased. "A what, Susan?" said the man's
voice. "Remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;in a top hat," said the second voice.</p>

<p>"You know that travellers sometimes have top hats,
Susan," cautioned the first voice.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's a gentleman, James&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well, let us hope you're not mistaken and that
you were hooked up behind. Ask the gentleman to wait
a minute."</p>

<p>The voices ceased.</p>

<p>Instinctively Louie had walked to a half-open coach
door and had looked through. She saw a bright little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
picture. A horse was being put into a gay yellow trap,
and the man who was buckling the harness had begun to
sing again:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
"Oryn&mdash;thia, my Belovèd!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
</div>

<p>All that Louie could see of him was a pair of glossy black
boots and a pair of grey check trousers cut close about the
knee. The harness twinkled; the horse's coat shone in the
sun like Mr. Jeffries' hair; and somebody within the stable
was running water into a bucket. Then the man came
round the horse, and she saw him&mdash;cropped silver hair,
long dewlapped chin, and a back and shoulders that might
have served Henson's turn yet. And as Louie watched,
with no more emotion than if the scene had been one on a
coloured bioscope, he sang again:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Oryn&mdash;thia, my Belovèd!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
</div>

<p>Then, as she watched, it came over her for the first time
that she had planned and was performing a suspect thing.
She had no right to inspect this man and then to know
him or not to know him, as she chose. He had no less
right to inspect her. She, not he, stood to gain; cards on
the table, then; either she must go away at once, taking
Chaff with her, or else take her courage in both hands
without further spying.</p>

<p>Which was, perhaps, as much as to say that she had
already seen and was willing to risk it.</p>

<p>She passed through the half-open door into the yard.</p>

<p>Yet even as she advanced she had a final cowardice.
By a man at any rate, anything would be forgiven her, and
she really had had a long walk.... There was a bench
by the stable door.... But she pulled herself together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
No, not that. She was not faint, only very, very pale.
She continued to advance.</p>

<p>Then Buck looked up, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>They say of a newly born infant that your first impression
of facial resemblance is that to which the child,
grown a man, will return. So perhaps it was for one moment
with father and daughter. But, if so, it passed instantly.
Buck made an upward, deferential gesture of
his fore-finger.</p>

<p>"Sha'n't be three minutes, m'm," he said. "Now,
Judson, the lady's here! He's just ready, m'm. A beautiful
day!"</p>

<p>Then something in Louie's look seemed to strike him.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> for Mrs. Allonby's, m'm, isn't it? For one-fifteen;
one-fifteen Allonby, Richards, seven to-night.
You needn't have come; he'll be there sharp."</p>

<p>Louie was looking steadily at her father. "You've
made a mistake," she said.</p>

<p>"What? Hi, Judson! What's this?"</p>

<p>"I came&mdash;I came&mdash;with the gentleman who's just
asked for you. Don't you&mdash;don't you&mdash;&mdash;" she faltered
and stopped.</p>

<p>"But aren't you from Mrs. Allonby's?"</p>

<p>Louie was conscious that she was becoming pitifully
flurried. She could not believe now that she had ever
thought this would be an easy thing to do. And she
would have to do it all herself; he had a handsome,
slightly pompous face, but it was not the face of a
man who apprehends things by intuition. She tried
again.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Causton, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, m'm? You see, one ear&mdash;&mdash;" The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Piker had burst the drum of one of Buck's ears. He inclined
his head. "What did you say, m'm?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Louie put one hand on the shaft of the trap
and sank half sitting on the step. The trap dipped. Her
pallor was now extreme.</p>

<p>"The gentleman who wishes to see you&mdash;&mdash;" she began
again.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'm?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I came with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'm&mdash;aren't you well, m'm?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"If it isn't Mrs. Allonby's, one-fifteen&mdash;&mdash;" said Buck.</p>

<p>"His name&mdash;the gentleman's name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, as the horse lifted a foot, she slipped a little on
the step. She might not have fallen, but his old and
instinctive muscular discipline counted for something.
Buck had made a remarkably swift movement, and his arm
now supported her. Suddenly she surrendered her
weight to him.</p>

<p>"Here, m'm," said the astonished Buck, "come and set
down on the bench."</p>

<p>Louie turned up entreating eyes. "You can't guess?"</p>

<p>"If it's Richards, seven&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The gentleman's name&mdash;I came with&mdash;is Chaffinger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You said&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Chaffinger."</p>

<p>She was too close to him to notice that he too had
suddenly become white. He still held her, but slowly
half a cubic foot of air came from his chest. Probably
with a purely mechanical movement he set her on her feet.
His hand was at his sound ear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you say it again, m'm?" he said huskily.</p>

<p>Louie did so.</p>

<p>"Cap-Captain Chaffinger, m'm?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Louie choked, "don't call me 'm'm'!"</p>

<p>"You did say Captain Chaffinger?"</p>

<p>Then, leaning limply against the shaft, Louie began
to speak low and rapidly.</p>

<p>"Send me away if you like&mdash;perhaps I was stupid to
come&mdash;but I wanted&mdash;I wanted&mdash;I couldn't bear it any
longer&mdash;I'm all alone&mdash;father! I'm Louie&mdash;Louie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Only Buck's Maker knows whether even then he fully
understood. His grey eyes were stupidly on her grey eyes.
Her voice, as she continued to mutter broken phrases,
possibly lost itself in his deaf ear; but some other sense
informed him that she was telling him that she was his
daughter&mdash;his daughter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then at one of her phrases, he seemed to come
sluggishly to life. He repeated the phrase after her.</p>

<p>"Putney, m'm? Did you say Putney?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I live there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You live in Putney? Whereabouts in Putney?"</p>

<p>"Mortlake Road."</p>

<p>Buck made another sluggish effort. A quarter of a
century and more before he had said to the Honourable
Emily: "<i>The</i> Bible, Miss?" Now he said to his daughter:</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> Mortlake Road?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"You live there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Now Mallard Bois and Trant were more than geographically
remote from Buck. They had the immeasurable remoteness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of the Scarisbricks. But Putney was near. To
keep himself in spring and condition, he frequently
walked over to Putney. Putney was a place you could
walk to, and it had streets and houses and a green Tillings'
bus. And they rowed the boat race there. Therefore,
while it outraged all Order that a Scarisbrick should live
there, that fact nevertheless brought his daughter into the
same world with himself. For the first time he looked
seeingly at her, and as he looked, there vanished, more
quickly than a finger is snapped, whatever images of her
had beguiled his fancy through the years.</p>

<p>This, then, was she, standing against the shaft with
head back, lips parted, brows entreatingly drawn, her
whole pose an appeal.</p>

<p>"Father," she was saying, smiling crookedly through
those rare things, her tears&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Judson came out of the stable. Buck gave him a curt
order, and the trap moved away. Its departure left Louie
standing by the little bench outside the stable door. Buck
had taken a step towards her. He was murmuring something
quite ridiculous&mdash;something about "strictly for the
gentry." Perhaps he remembered that had his little girl
been a little boy he would have given her instruction for
nothing at the Sparring Academy in Bruton Street.</p>

<p>All in a moment he passed his arm about Louie. Scarisbrick
or not, she was going to be a Causton and his for
once&mdash;just for once. In an hour he might be calling her
"m'm" again, but just for once&mdash;his face was beautiful.</p>

<p>"That little girl," he said foolishly, holding her
with as gentle a fear as if she had been still in her cradle.</p>

<p>Louie's answer was to faint suddenly on his breast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">But of the Molyneux Arms in a moment. A word
about Mortlake Road first.</p>

<p>Two houses had been thrown into one to form the
establishment at which Louie had now resided for a week.
Officially it was a nursing home; actually it accepted declared
invalids and quite well but unrobust lodgers alike.
Miss Cora Mayville "ran" it; her cousin, Miss Dot Mayville,
was "sister," and from four to eight uniformed
nurses came and went continually. None of them had
theories, moral, social, or of any other description; to
them things were as they were. Nurse Meekins made
Louie's bed as who should say, "Helpers of people in
trouble do not go beyond their proper business"; Nurse
Chalmers brought her letters or called her to dinner in
the narrowminded spirit of one who leaves the systematics
of charity to others. All were reprehensibly incurious and
shockingly affectionate, and so far was Louie's case from
being peculiar that, in the eyes of the law at any rate, Miss
Dot Mayville was herself twice a parent. Twice (when,
from reasons Lord Moone could have explained, the real
parents had refused to do so) she had signed the birth-certificates
of undesired infants. This irregularity the
registrar for the district held perpetually over her head.
She laughed, and held other things over his head in return.
They were engaged to be married.</p>

<p>It was to this retreat that Buck drove Louie back that
January evening, cutting "Richards, seven" without compunction.
Poor Chaff had been sent off soon after lunch;
there was somebody else to fetch and despatch his Mops
now. Buck lifted Louie from the trap and rang the bell
of one of the two brass-plated doors. A German youth
dressed as a waiter appeared, and Buck bade him hold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
horse. Then he went with Louie up to her room. He
took off her hat and coat for her; he seemed unable to leave
her. He had learned how it was with her.</p>

<p>He had hardly turned a hair at the news. He accepted
it as part of the Scheme of Things. To him also indiscretions
were of two kinds&mdash;indiscretions, and the indiscretions
of the Scarisbricks. Only a wistful look had
crossed his face; he had hoped Louie's somebody was a
gentleman otherwise than in the top-hat sense of the word;
and Louie had reassured him about that. For the rest, it
was not for Buck to inquire into the private affairs of
these great ones. He would as soon have allowed the
young German who held the horse to inquire into his
own.</p>

<p>"That little girl," he said once more, holding her away
from him at the side of her bed.</p>

<p>"And you won't call me 'm'm,' daddy?" Louie
laughed.</p>

<p>Buck gave it thought; it was not so simple as it looked.
"And you really took daddy's name?" he asked. He
had asked it twenty times already.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And told all those young ladies?" (Louie had related
the incident of Burnett Minor and the "Life and
Battles.") "All about daddy and the Piker?"</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>Buck found it too wonderful. He enfolded his little
girl again.</p>

<p>"But you must go now," Louie said by-an-by.</p>

<p>"But I can come in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And, daddy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Little girl?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll be good to poor old Chaff? He's fond of me
too."</p>

<p>Buck promised that he would. Had there been none
other, the tantrums of the Honourable Emily were no
doubt bond enough between them.</p>

<p>The next morning Buck had to be told that eight o'clock
was too early for a visit, and so, on the next morning again,
he did not turn up until eleven. After that eleven became
his accustomed hour. Wet or fine was the same to him,
and he cancelled all afternoon orders for the trap; his little
girl must have the trap at her disposal for a daily drive.
And because his fidelity to the Social Order and their own
professional tolerances amounted in Louie's case to pretty
much the same thing, the nurses one and all fell in love
with Buck.</p>

<p>And here, once for all, or at any rate for a long time, a
cogent matter may be dismissed, even as those pagan nurses
dismissed it. It is Louie's conviction of moral guilt as
apart from her persuasion of the practical inconveniences
of it. Louie Causton would have been poor stuff for the
hot gospeller to practise upon. There were things she
would have had undone, and that not merely because the
consequences pressed upon her; as they could not be undone,
she had begun the tune and intended to fiddle it out.
What she saw fit to hide her historian hides also. Louie
seized what happiness she could, and it served. She was
sorrier for Chaff than she was for herself. She would
have been less happy had she taken Uncle Augustus's way
out.</p>

<p>And whether the days were happy or not, at any rate
they were peacefully alike. Breakfast with the nurses,
a morning or afternoon drive with Buck or a walk along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the river bank or on Putney Heath, tea (if they drove)
perhaps at Kingston, supper with the nurses again, and
bed&mdash;that was the tale of them. She kept her promise
to Chaff; several times he came to see her. Twice he met
Buck. At these meetings the shade of the Honourable
Emily almost visibly presided.... Chaff tried to talk
of "Lives and Battles," Buck of the same&mdash;it was not for
him to choose topics before his betters. And once, but
once only, Buck brought Mrs. Buck, formerly Susan Emmidge,
the chemist's servant at Mallard Bois. He hooked
her up behind himself before they left Kingston, and Louie
did her the same service at the end of the visit. For the
rest, if Louie wanted to see her father's second wife she
had to go to the Molyneux Arms to do so.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">II</p>

<p>As the singer of "The Pilgrim of Love" Buck was
known far and abroad up the Thames. It will be
believed that he contrived to get an infinite personal pathos
into the song; he also made of it, by means of those gratuitous
aspirates, an affective athletic exercise in breathing.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"No re-(<i>h</i>)est&mdash;but the gra-(<i>h</i>)ave<br />
For the Pi-(<i>h</i>)ilgrim of Love!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
</div>

<p>As he closed his eyes at each soaring, the effect was as if
he inwardly looked back on that remarkable pilgrimage
of his own. Bidden to marry, he had married; bidden
to unmarry and to marry again, he had done so; and at a
word from Louie he would have taken up the pilgrimage
once more.</p>

<p>But while Buck exalted the Scarisbricks high above himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
so also he exalted himself high above all beneath him.
He ruled the Molyneux Arms with a rod of iron. Only
mediately and through him would the two barmaids have
dared to address Louie; and his wife's position was altogether
anomalous. It was only because Louie would
have it so that she sat down to tea with them; and, what
with her hooks and eyes and Buck's perpetual admonitions,
there was little rest but the grave for her either. Buck
subscribed to the <i>Almanack de Gotha</i> and <i>Modern Society</i>;
these were always to hand; but <i>The Licensed Victuallers'
Gazette</i>, which he took in the way of business, was kept
out of Louie's way. Mr. Mackie he would have torn from
limb to limb. Far more royalist than the king was Buck;
Radicalism was chaos, which word he pronounced "tchayoss."
Of pugilism, save to Chaff, he never spoke. "God
bless the Squire and his relations."</p>

<p>And (Louie thought) God bless this simple-hearted
father of hers also. Buck in the ring had been a better
man than Uncle Augustus in the House of Lords, and
Henson would not have looked twice at Chaff. Granted
he was pompous; with a little more pompousness her
mother would have come more creditably out of that old
affair. So much for the Scarisbricks. Already, in January,
Louie loved her father; by March his daily visit
was a necessity of her life. She had been right; her
destiny was quite as likely to be bound up with Buck and
his beer-pumps as with anything in that dingy old Business
School.</p>

<p>Of the Business School she still thought a good deal,
however. She could not forget the interesting little drama
of which she had seen, as it were, the first act. Somehow,
time and distance had simplified some of its details
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
without diminishing her interest in it, and, as she walked
along the Putney towpath by day, or lay awake in her
white-painted room at night, she wondered that this should
be so. By the brutal logic of events, Rainham Parva
should have been nearer to her than Holborn; but Rainham
Parva seemed now disproportionately remote. Why?</p>

<p>Had the conclusion which persisted in presenting itself
not been impossible, perhaps she would not have faced it
so frankly. It was impossible&mdash;manifestly absurd&mdash;that
Mr. Jeffries should have any hold on her imagination.
Therefore she allowed herself to consider it. No doubt the
fancies which filled her head would pass and be forgotten.</p>

<p>Give them a month, then&mdash;two months.</p>

<p>She gave them that, and more. They did not pass.
But that, no doubt, was due to the curious interrupted
story. She felt as if she was reading an interesting serial
tale, for the next instalment of which she was suddenly
required to wait another month. She wanted to know
what was going to happen among the fair, perky boy, the
girl who resembled Polly Ross, the lionlike Mr. Jeffries,
and that apocryphal fourth actor in the piece. When she
had learned that she would close the book. In the meantime
she occupied herself, as serial readers do, with guessing.</p>

<p>The spring was advancing towards May when there
happened something that suddenly precipitated her guessings.
Buck still came daily, but she walked more in the
back garden of the nursing home now and less on the
heath and on the towpath, and drove, when she did drive,
more slowly. Sometimes on her drives a nurse accompanied
her. Her doctor found her health excellent.</p>

<p>The thing that happened began with Richenda Earle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Some weeks before, Louie had had a letter from Richenda
forwarded from Sutherland Place, which she had neglected
to answer; and Richenda had apparently written again,
this time to her sister. Louie now gathered that Mrs.
Leggat had kept the reason for her disappearance from
Mr. Weston, but not from Richenda. By way of Richenda
and Mr. Weston it had now reached the Business School.
A hastily scrawled letter from Kitty Windus informed
Louie of this. Kitty wanted to come and see her.</p>

<p>Well, there was no reason why Kitty should not come.
Louie wrote and told her so.</p>

<p>She came on a Saturday afternoon. It was not urgently
necessary that Louie should have received her in
bed, but the recollection of the spinster's peering eyes held
some obscure prompting. Moreover, to receive Kitty in
bed would be an intimation that the call must not be a
long one, and she had arranged its duration with Miss Dot
Mayville.</p>

<p>"Miss Windus," Miss Dot announced, and Kitty entered.</p>

<p>She had brought Louie a bunch of violets; that was the
first of several new amenities Louie noticed in her manner.
Louie discouraged the second amenity, which was a
shy motion as if to embrace her. And the third showed
when, after a few minutes in which Kitty's fluttered spirits
had become a little calmer (<i>she</i> was not the one to turn her
back on people in trouble, she had said, let others hold
up their heads as they pleased), she wistfully took Louie's
hand on the coverlet. She had cried over Louie a little.
Her eyes were still wet.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;but I don't know whether you've heard&mdash;I
might have been just like everybody else, only something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
else has made an awful difference too," she said, her eyes
downcast.</p>

<p>"Oh? What else?" Louie asked a little offhandedly.
She had not wanted to be wept over.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you haven't heard.... I'm engaged. I've
been engaged nearly two months."</p>

<p>"Really? Then I must congratulate you. Is it a
secret who to?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kitty. "It's to Mr. Jeffries."</p>

<p>Slowly Louie sat up. She turned, as if, like Buck, she
had been deaf on one side. "<i>Who?</i>" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. To Mr. Jeffries. Since early in March. You
remember he told Archie there was somebody?&mdash;and,"
Kitty became suddenly voluble, "I couldn't believe my
ears at first. I'd never dreamed&mdash;never dreamed. And
after I'd been such a beast&mdash;I don't mean a beast exactly,
but getting at him, you know. I was just as bad as the
others&mdash;about his baths and all that. Oh, I did feel
ashamed&mdash;as mean as mean&mdash;oh!" She choked a little.
"I don't mind saying it now, but I'd&mdash;I'd begun to be
afraid I should <i>never</i> get off!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no, I mean," Louie murmured, dazed.</p>

<p>"Just fancy, it's being me! That night, when he
asked me, I thought I should have gone clean off it. Sometimes
I can hardly believe it yet. I hadn't a notion&mdash;not
a notion! And it makes everything perfectly wonderful,
knowing a man's so struck on you, though he <i>is</i> quiet and
don't say much about it. Of course they mean all the
more, that sort. We walk along the streets, but he won't
let me stop out late for fear of tiring me, and he always
takes me right to the door, and I'm trying hard not to be
selfish, but it makes me so sorry for other girls who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
haven't got off&mdash;and perhaps if I sell some of my shares to
start us with we can get married next year&mdash;if he gets a
permanency, that is."</p>

<p>Louie was still thunderstruck. Mr. Jeffries engaged
to&mdash;Kitty Windus! That unnamed personage was&mdash;Kitty
Windus! She, Louie, was asked to believe <i>that</i>, in
the face of all she had seen!</p>

<p>"I am glad," she found herself murmuring again.</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> guess?" Kitty asked eagerly. She would
have given her ears to be told that somebody else had
guessed.</p>

<p>"No," Louie replied, and added, seeing Kitty's fallen
face: "I should have thought Mr. Merridew. You
seemed such great friends."</p>

<p>At that Kitty broke in: "Poor Archie! I said it
made one selfish.... His father's very ill. We were
going on Putney Heath to-day, all four of us, Archie and
Evie and Jeff and me; but Archie had a wire to go home
this morning, poor Archie, and so I'm going to meet the
others by-and-by. But anyway, if anything does happen,
he'll be able to get married as soon as he likes&mdash;he's an
only son."</p>

<p>At this Louie was even more startled. Mr. Jeffries and
the Soames girl together at that moment! She remembered
those irrevocable looks.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Merridew and Miss Soames are engaged,
then?" she said.</p>

<p>"Well," Kitty admitted, "it comes to the same thing.
They're as good as. I wish Jeff was coming into a bit,
like Archie."</p>

<p>"You say they're here, at Putney, this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Jeff and Evie? Yes. I'm meeting them at five."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Even as Louie was inwardly predicting that Kitty would
not see her Mr. Jeffries at five, Miss Dot Mayville entered.
But Louie did not want Kitty to go just yet. She wanted
to know more of this extraordinary development of her
drama. "May we have some tea?" she asked, and Miss
Dot went out again. Louie lay back on her pillow and
frowned at the foot of her white-painted bed.</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you to give up your afternoon to
me," she said by-and-by.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, as if I wouldn't!" Kitty broke out almost
reproachfully. "I keep telling myself I mustn't be
selfish, when Jeff and I have years before us&mdash;I'm just
beginning to realise it&mdash;years&mdash;and, oh dear, here I am,
selfish again, talking all about myself and never a word
about you."</p>

<p>But Louie did not want words about herself. She
wanted to hear all, all, about Kitty and Mr. Jeffries. The
thing became more incredible moment by moment.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about Mr. Merridew's father," she said
presently. "I suppose Miss Soames is very much upset?"</p>

<p>"Frightfully," said Kitty. "But Jeff's looking after
her. It was he who persuaded her to go out this afternoon.
It's better for her than moping indoors."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Merridew asked him to."</p>

<p>"Oh no. He only got the wire this morning. But it
isn't a surprise. Jeff saw him last night&mdash;&mdash;" She
checked herself. She had no gibes about brown-paper
parcels now.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be quite a courting quartet," said Louie
presently, with a brightness she did not feel.</p>

<p>"Yes; jolly, isn't it? But there, I'm simply <i>not</i> going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
to talk about myself one moment longer. I feel a regular
beast. But it's only because I'm so happy. Now let's
talk about you. How long are you going to be here?
What sort of people are they? Isn't it fearfully expensive?
Are you frightened?"</p>

<p>The suppressed inquisitive questions and Louie's preoccupied
parries lasted through tea. At a quarter to five
Kitty rose. Again Louie found herself wondering whether
Kitty would see her Mr. Jeffries that day. Kitty bent
over her.</p>

<p>"I should like to kiss you, dear, if you'd let me," she
said timidly. "You wouldn't believe what a difference
it makes. And I'd love to come again; I love little babies.
Now I must run. I won't say a word to Miriam Levey;
you know what she is&mdash;but I simply must learn not to say
those things. Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>And she was off, waving her skimpy hand from the door.</p>

<p>Louie did not know why her heart should ache already,
as at a premonition&mdash;for she had no certitude. Indeed,
in all that portion of her relation to Mr. Jeffries she had no
certitude; but she was only a little less certain on that
account. Already she entirely rejected the figment in
which Kitty so pathetically believed. Months before she
had snapped her fingers at his impudent tale of a shadowy
<i>fiancée</i>; now she wondered whether he had not been caught
in his own trap and found himself compelled, by mere
daily exigencies, to give that shadow substance&mdash;the substance
of Kitty. Impossible&mdash;and yet the conceivable alternatives
were equally impossible! Incredible that he
should have chosen Kitty for his stalking-horse&mdash;yet whom
else had there been to choose? If this really was a putting-upon
the Business School, Mr. Jeffries would see to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
it that his dupe was as known as his purpose was secret.
That left him three candidates from whom to choose indifferently&mdash;Kitty,
Miriam Levey, and herself.</p>

<p>In her indignation she was unconscious of the pink that
crept like a danger signal into her cheeks.</p>

<p>That poor, unconscious, betrayed woman!</p>

<p>Good gracious! It was blackguardly and monstrous!
Kitty of all women! To have "predestined spinster"
written large all over you was bad enough, without being
played upon thus and then cast back into spinsterhood
after all! And this new softness of Kitty's, this timid
opening of the heart, this new, awkward unselfishness,
these pathetic little maxims of conduct! The man must
be a cur. Deliberately to waken a heart that was sealed,
asleep and not unhappy, and then to leave it to a pain it
must keep for ever&mdash;good gracious!</p>

<p>Still ignorant of the tell-tale red in her own cheeks, she
found Mr. Jeffries vile.</p>

<p>But she must be just to Mr. Jeffries. Perhaps she was
wrong. Perhaps there was&mdash;nay, there must be&mdash;something
she didn't know. Why, even if Mr. Jeffries could be
so cruel, Kitty herself could hardly be so blind. Struggle
with new magnanimities as she would, jealousy was native
to Kitty, and jealousy has sharp eyes. No, she, Louie
herself, was building a fantastic fabric. It was mere
common-sense that Kitty must be supposed to be capable
of looking after herself.</p>

<p>But it was one thing to tell herself that she must
suspend her judgment and another to do it. That theory
of hers seemed to unroll itself brightly and convincingly
before her again. She would discard it when she found
one that better explained the known facts. Mr. Jeffries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
was with Evie Soames at that moment. Louie's thoughts
flew to Evie Soames.</p>

<p>It was then that she became conscious that her cheeks
were hot. It was then also that she told herself angrily
that they were not, and found them grow hotter still. The
hotter they grew the more she denied their heat. Why
should they grow hot? And even granting that they were
hot, wasn't this imposture that was being practised on
Kitty enough to make anybody's cheek hot? That was it.
That discovery made, she admitted the heat&mdash;for Kitty's
sake. That that great, taciturn, clever man should be
infatuated by that pretty fool she resented&mdash;for Kitty's
sake. That his sleek head, bright as the coat of Buck's
horse, should stoop over that empty dark one she found
ironically unfit&mdash;for Kitty's sake. She told herself all
this, forgetting that she had just set Kitty's engagement
down also as an absurdity. Her indignation would have
been neither more nor less honest had Mr. Jeffries engaged
himself (as according to her theory he might quite well
have done) to Miriam Levey.</p>

<p>Or to herself.</p>

<p>She lay, the colour coming and going.</p>

<p>At last she roused herself and sat up. "Pretty
thoughts for an expectant mother!" she muttered. "I'll
go downstairs and talk to Dot."</p>

<p>She dressed, and descended to the nurses' sitting-room
in the basement.</p>

<p>Miss Dot and her Registrar were there; they had just
come in from a walk. They were telling of a nightingale
they had heard sing near Queens Mere. "Oh, and we
saw your friend again, the one who came to tea," said Miss
Dot, turning to Louie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>Louie pricked up her ears. "Oh? Alone?" she said
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Coming down Putney Hill."</p>

<p>"Yes, she said she was going to take a walk," Louie remarked.</p>

<p>But to herself she cried with conviction: "I knew it&mdash;I
knew it&mdash;I knew it!"</p>

<p>For the rest of the evening she was lost in her own
thoughts. Miss Cora Mayville worked a hand sewing
machine; Miss Dot and her Registrar played bézique at a
separate table; other nurses, in print aprons or cloaked
and bonneted, came and went; but Louie sat and gazed
into the fire. When spoken to she smiled mechanically
and then resumed her gazing. There was no more continuity
in her thoughts than there was in the shape of the
flames that illumined her grey eyes. Roy appeared in
them for a moment or two&mdash;she had seen Roy's name in
<i>The Gazette</i> a week before&mdash;and then Roy was supplanted
by Burnett Minor. Her old French governess at Trant
popped up for no particular reason, and then she too gave
place to Mr. Mackie. She heard Buck saying again,
"That little girl"&mdash;and then came a wrangle between Dot
and her Registrar. In the adjoining kitchen she heard
sounds of frying, and then somebody came in to lay the
table for supper. The gas rose and whistled as the stove
in the next room was turned off. The three night nurses
came down. Louie had her gruel where she sat, and at
half-past nine went upstairs again. She got into bed, and
dreamed that night that she was dancing with Mr. Jeffries
again at the breaking-up party. Her hand lay like a willow
leaf in his. "<i>You</i> understand," he was saying to her;
"it's no good hiding things from <i>you</i>; <i>you've</i> got the key
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
of it all. It had to be somebody, and you'd left. There
was only Kitty for it. You see what an ignominious
thing you escape. Don't tell me how degrading it is; I
know it; but I'd do it a thousand times for the woman I
loved and meant to marry."</p>

<p>Louie knew, in her dream, who that was.</p>

<p>Then she awoke with a start. The street lamp outside,
shining through the venetian blinds, made long bars of
light on the walls and ceiling. The hot-water bottle at
her feet was cold. She heard the creaking of Dot's bed in
the little dressing-room adjoining, and the minute ticking
of her watch on the table by her bed-head. But what had
woke her had been the sound of her own reply, in her
dream, to Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>"You'll shuffle Kitty off," she had replied, still dancing
with him, "but <i>I</i> should have found a way to keep
you."</p>

<p>Then, with a deep sigh, she turned and went to sleep
again.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">III</p>

<p>Her boy was born towards the end of June. Her
mother did not visit her; instead, she sent a letter
the chief characteristic of which was fright that she had
dared even so far to disobey her brother. Louie understood,
and in her dictated reply made allowances. She
wondered whether she should write to Roy also, but in the
end did not. The child was born at three o'clock in the
morning; he was hardly six hours old when Buck arrived.
The old champion stood looking down on his little girl's
little boy. It was long before he spoke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"I wasn't let see you," he said, two big tears rolling
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"You shall teach him to box, daddy," said Louie, smiling
up at him.</p>

<p>But Buck shook his head. "No, no," he said gently&mdash;"except
just to take care of himself&mdash;when he's fourteen,
perhaps&mdash;if I'm here. Swimming, not sparring. They're
a queer lot, them in the ring."</p>

<p>"You must go now, Mr. Causton," said Miss Dot.</p>

<p>The boy was thirty hours old when there arrived for him
a great case of toys suitable for a child of four. Buck and
Chaff had been round the toyshops together. Mrs. Buck,
disobeying her husband for the only time in her life, came
by stealth with a flannel binder that might have enwrapped
a six-pounds' child; Jim (as Louie had decided to call
him), weighed ten pounds, beef to the heel.</p>

<p>He throve at once, and continued to thrive.</p>

<p>The pair of them were the pride of that pagan Putney
Nursing Home.</p>

<p>The first of the two incidents that may be allowed to
close this portion of Louie's story was a second visit by
Kitty Windus to Louie.</p>

<p>She came at ten o'clock at night, and only with difficulty
obtained admission. She was allowed ten minutes, on the
condition that Louie was awake. Louie was awake.
Kitty neither lifted her veil nor asked to see the child.
There was no trace now of her little maxims of conduct;
she spoke agitatedly, and out of a stinging, jealous
pain.</p>

<p>"I've come to ask you something, Miss Causton, and
you've got to tell me," she announced, without preface.
"I've a right to know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak a little lower," said Louie, glancing at the babe.
"Sit down and tell me what it is."</p>

<p>But Kitty would not sit. Incapable of grandeurs of
style, she nevertheless attempted them.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you happen to be aware what
people are saying about you," she said. Her boat-shaped
hat and Inverness cape gave her a little the appearance
of a scanty tree with which some topiary artist had done
his best.</p>

<p>Louie could not help smiling a little; she could have that
kind of thing out with herself without calling in Kitty.</p>

<p>"My dear! Of course I know they might be saying
anything!" She drew her child a little closer to her.</p>

<p>"Suppose we keep the my dears till we've finished talking,"
said Kitty coldly. "I mean what they're saying at
the Business School."</p>

<p>Louie spoke quietly. "I suppose you mean about me
and my boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do mean that, and I've come to ask you to your
face; <i>I'm</i> not the one to beat about the bush! I want to
know who&mdash;&mdash;" There was no need for Kitty to complete
the sentence.</p>

<p>"You won't know that," said Louie, more quietly still.</p>

<p>"Ah! perhaps you won't tell me because you daren't?"</p>

<p>"I've not told anybody, and I'm not going to tell you.
I'd die first. Perhaps before we go any further you'll tell
me why you want to know?"</p>

<p>"You don't suppose I'd ask you if it wasn't my business,
do you?"</p>

<p>Slowly Louie turned her eyes on her. She spoke slowly
too. "We should get on more quickly if you didn't jump
so to conclusions," she said. "I don't know what your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
conclusions are, but you seem to have made your mind up
about something. If you'll change your tone I'll talk to
you; if you won't, I won't."</p>

<p>At that Kitty began to sob. She had to lift her veil in
order to put a wisp of wet handkerchief to her eyes. But
she changed her tone.</p>

<p>"I only want to know," she said. "And I don't want
to know if it isn't my business. But I <i>have</i> seen him look
at you, and he <i>did</i> dance with you, and when they
said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who said?" Louie interrupted; but she had already
made a guess. "And said what?"</p>

<p>"Jeff, of course," Kitty replied. "Miriam Levey
noticed him looking at you first, but after that I saw for
myself. And you did dance with him. I might forgive
him, but I'd never, never forgive <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Louie suddenly put a question. Apparently it was for
nothing less preposterous than that question that Kitty
was here.</p>

<p>"One moment," she said. "Do you mean there's
something about Mr. Jeffries and myself you want to
know?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I mean to know," Kitty snapped.</p>

<p>"And that's all?"</p>

<p>"Enough, <i>I</i> should say!"</p>

<p>"Please hear me out. In fact"&mdash;Louie paused for a
moment and then rapped out sharply&mdash;"you want to know
whether my lover was Mr. Jeffries?"</p>

<p>"That'll do to be going on with," said Kitty sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you if you'll tell me who said he was."</p>

<p>"I don't see what that's got to do with it, but I'll tell
you if you like. Archie Merridew said so. There!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>Archie Merridew!&mdash;But Louie restrained her gasp.
"Thank you," she said. "May I ask whether you've
asked Mr. Jeffries? <i>He</i> might be in a position to know,
you know."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't."</p>

<p>"But evidently you've seen something in his manner
that would make it not quite impossible?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, you've danced with him, and he's looked at
you in a sort of way&mdash;more than once, Miriam says&mdash;and
you're trying to shuffle out of the question," said Kitty,
her suspicions aflame again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll answer the question! If it had been he"&mdash;she
glanced at the little head under her breast&mdash;"I'd tell
you in a minute&mdash;for my baby's sake, you see. But it was
not; and you might have saved yourself a journey if you'd
gone to him first. And now please tell me a little more."</p>

<p>Kitty still looked at her suspiciously. "You said you'd
die sooner than tell," she cried quaveringly.</p>

<p>"You mean you don't believe me? Well, I can't make
you. If I told you the truth you'd just think I'd made up
a name."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> somebody else?" cried Kitty eagerly.</p>

<p>If it wasn't Mr. Jeffries, naturally&mdash;there was the
child&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>want</i> to believe you!" Kitty suddenly broke
out.</p>

<p>Louie laughed desperately. "Well, my dear, you may.
If it was so, I suppose you'd get it out of me. It isn't,
that's all. And now I think I've a right to know exactly
what this Mr. Merridew has been saying."</p>

<p>Kitty looked hard at her for one moment longer, and
then sank on her knees by the side of the bed. She had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
choice but to believe. She broke into a torrent of words,
low-spoken, not to rouse the child. Louie heard them,
amazed. Slowly her incredulity turned into contempt.</p>

<p>The horrid little beast! But, after all, she was not surprised.
It was all in his character. Perhaps he had been
drunk; perhaps it was merely a fancy-stationery idea of
humour. Not that she minded a straw; she laughed; she
supposed she was there to have stones thrown at her; it
was merely a little annoying that they were not thrown
straighter. She could picture the over-pocket-monied little
bounder, measuring all pecks out of his own bushel,
leaning up against a bar somewhere, probably too fuddled
to distinguish his own humorous fancy from a story of
life with names given, and believing it himself by the time
he had repeated it once or twice.</p>

<p>The little worm!</p>

<p>"But," she said presently, disgustedly smiling, "<i>you</i>
remember when I came to the School, and that I asked <i>you</i>
who Mr. Jeffries was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course!" said Kitty, suddenly entirely believing.
"How absurd! But oh, I do love him so."</p>

<p>Louie mused.</p>

<p>"And he&mdash;Mr. Jeffries&mdash;knows nothing about this, you
say?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"No. He thinks something's wrong. He's been teaching
at the School, you know, and of course he must have
wondered what was the matter all this last week."</p>

<p>"It's a week since Mr. Merridew&mdash;did me this favour?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But perhaps Jeff thought&mdash;&mdash;" She checked
herself.</p>

<p>"What? I think I ought to know what Mr. Jeffries
may have thought."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty hesitated, and then, with a little burst, told her.
It was curious. It appeared that Mr. Jeffries had been
very hard up indeed, so hard up that, quite recently, he
had actually had to take a position as a commissionaire.
It was known, and possibly he had set any oddities of behaviour
towards himself down to that.</p>

<p>A commissionaire! Louie was astounded.</p>

<p>"And aren't you going to tell him?" she managed to
get out.</p>

<p>"I must, the very next time I see him."</p>

<p>"You mean to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You see"&mdash;Kitty hesitated again&mdash;"he's
left the School. Practically been dismissed. He's
got some work at Bedford now."</p>

<p>"Dismissed on account of this?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"And now, of course, you've got to tell him that you
believed this?"</p>

<p>Kitty dropped her head on the bed. She gave a little
moan. "I don't know how I shall ever do it!" she
groaned in the bedclothes.</p>

<p>Louie considered herself entitled to agree that it
wouldn't be easy.</p>

<p>Presently Kitty rose. She crossed to Louie's mirror
and adjusted the boat-shaped hat. Then she came back to
the bedside again and craned her head forward.</p>

<p>"May I see the baby?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Another time, I think," said Louie, her lips compressed.</p>

<p>Kitty left.</p>

<p>Louie's mind was in a whirl. At her request, Kitty had
turned out the gas before leaving, and only a nightlight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
glimmered on the little invalid's table. She gazed at it.
So she too had been haled into the drama!</p>

<p>On the young fancy stationer she wasted never a thought,
either of indignation or of anything else; but Kitty&mdash;Evie
Soames&mdash;Mr. Jeffries&mdash;Roy&mdash;herself!&mdash;What a nightmare&mdash;what
a pantomime! What an incredible genius
this Mr. Jeffries seemed to have for getting himself into
complications and dragging other people after him! It
might well have puzzled anybody&mdash;anybody who had not
the key of the puzzle&mdash;to know which among them all he
really had honoured with his choice! Only Miss Levey
seemed to be immune. Surely, for the sake of completeness,
he could have found a way of dragging her in too!</p>

<p>Louie had to hold her key exceedingly firmly in order
to retain even that lunatic theory that seemed to be the
truth.</p>

<p>By dint of holding fast, however, the theory still stood
the strain. Evie Soames and Mr. Jeffries were still the
central figures of the piece. Kitty was still the stalking-horse
behind which, for whatever reasons, he machinated.
She herself was still merely dragged in at the whim of a
vicious little scoundrel over whose tongue whisky and
calumnies ran indifferently, and this little beast was still
engaged, or all but engaged, to Evie Soames. Yes, the
triangle re-established itself. Kitty and herself were no
more than imported complications. The big man and
the red-waistcoated youth were still the protagonists, and
they faced one another over the stupid little head of Evie
Soames.</p>

<p>And yet Louie, lying with her boy at her breast and blinking
at the nightlight, refused to class herself with the superfluous
Kitty. She did not see herself in a "walking on"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
part. Though she made her entry late, something told
her that she would have a word to say&mdash;or else it was a
botched and mangled piece indeed. Of life itself as a
botched and mangled piece she had no conception; though
she kept her thoughts of Him locked within her own breast,
it was still the bed of them that there <i>was</i> an Artist over
all. But for a false start she would have been on the
stage now, and she would have given a voice to that pitiful
part of poor Kitty's. Say she had not left that Holborn
School when she did&mdash;she remembered that breaking-up
dance&mdash;had one more opportunity like that been given to
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then in the darkness she coloured violently. She had
realised her own thoughts. This was as much as to say
that she would have accepted Kitty's rôle&mdash;would have consented
to be an understudy&mdash;would, like other understudies,
have ousted the principal in time&mdash;would have topped
the bill with a man the latest of whose mysterious activities
was that he had been a commissionaire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She loved, or was on the point of loving, Mr. Jeffries&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she ridiculed herself.</p>

<p>But nonsense or not, it was stronger than all her efforts
to think about something else. Perhaps it was her own
false start that set her wondering, and ever returning to
her wonder, whether he had not made one too. He seemed
to have set up the figure of Evie Soames in his own imagination,
and probably had not looked at Evie Soames as
she actually was since. He seemed to have his full share
of that masculine vanity which will have nothing to do
with the compromise by which the world jogs on; his rapt,
lion's eyes might see visions afar off, and he would not as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
much as know that his shins were black and raw with the
bruises of the hard facts among which he stumbled. Little
as Louie knew of him, she thought she knew that. Lucky
Evie Soames, who might be as stupid as the mud beneath
her feet, yet in one man's blind, far-seeing eyes could do
no wrong!</p>

<p>But of course it was nonsense that Louie should have to
recognise Evie Soames for her rival.</p>

<p>Yet, on one other point, as she lay with the babe at her
breast and her eyes fixed on the little flame of the nightlight,
she was already prepared to make a wager with herself.
Her theory was still only a theory; she could not
prove it; but it could prove itself. It would work out or it
would not work out; if it worked out&mdash;well, Louie was a
woman, and no woman hesitates for a single moment to put
on the mantle of the prophet. Indeed, she had prophesied
long before. "Circumstances are strong," this Mr. Jeffries
who had since been a commissionaire had admitted
when she had danced with him, "but is anybody ever
beaten unless they deserve to be?" And he had taken his
failure in the examination as a sign that he ought not to
have gone in for it, and had refused to enter again. Yes,
the earthenware vessel was on the point of collision with
the one of bronze, and which would break the months or
the weeks or the days would show. Kitty must not think
that it availed a predestined spinster anything that she got
engaged; Mr. Jeffries would never marry Kitty.</p>

<p>And if Louie herself had returned to the Business
School after Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Her dream of how she had danced with him, and he had
said "<i>You</i> understand," and she had replied, "<i>I</i> should
have found a way to keep you," returned vividly to her&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>She would have found a way.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that which even then had stood
between.</p>

<p>Excitedly she clutched her boy to her&mdash;he woke with the
pressure, and gave a little croaking cry.</p>

<p>This, then, was the first of the two things that remained
to be told about this part of Louie's story.</p>

<p>For the second of them she had neither years nor months
to wait, but a bare fortnight. A very few words will tell
it.</p>

<p>One evening after the boy had been put to bed she went
down into the nurses' parlour and helped Dot and Nurse
Chalmers to overhaul the blouses in which the doctors operated.
Besides themselves, only Miss Cora was present;
she was reading an evening paper. Louie saw her purse
her lips and then throw the paper away. Presently Louie,
tossing a patched blouse aside, reached for the paper.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Miss Cora, with a "Why, what's
the matter?" started forward and bent over her. Louie
had gone deathly white.</p>

<p>"It's nothing&mdash;I shall be all right presently," she muttered,
her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Miss Cora took the paper. The page at which she herself
had last looked was still uppermost. It contained an
account of a suicide.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" Miss Cora asked again. "Not
that?" She pointed to the paragraph. Indeed, there was
little else of interest on the page.</p>

<p>"I shall be all right in a minute," Louie murmured
again.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about the suicide. A
young man had hanged himself behind his bedroom door,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and a verdict in accordance with the evidence (which, it
was suggested, was largely medical) had been returned.
He had left a letter for his mother, precisely like almost
every other such letter, and parts of it were quoted. The
young man's name was Archie Merridew. He was to have
been married on the morrow.</p>

<p>"Is that it?" Miss Cora asked again.</p>

<p>Louie nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you know him?"</p>

<p>Louie made no reply.</p>

<p>They are experienced women at nursing homes; especially
about suppressed medical evidence they are able to
draw conclusions. The next morning a few rapid guarded
words passed between Louie and Miss Cora. The effect of
them was to give Louie a sudden feeling of nausea. Miss
Cora's whispered explanation seemed only too probable.
That also was all in his character.</p>

<p>"That's it, you may be sure," said Miss Cora. "They
ought to be lethal-chambered, nasty little sewer-rats; one
of 'em's saved them the trouble at any rate. Did you know
the girl he was going to marry too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Louie.</p>

<p>"Well, she's had an escape. But don't think about it.
You have your own little boy. Come into the garden till
your father comes and then have a nice long drive. Shall
we wrap Jimmy up and let him go with you?"</p>

<p>That, then, was the second thing; but already Louie had
heard a prophetical whisper in her soul.</p>

<h2 class="p6">PART IV<br />
PILLAR TO POST</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p class="center b1 p2">I</p>

<p>When, in the October of 1896, Louie Causton left
Mortlake Road, with half the nurses of the home
waving their handkerchiefs after her, she went to a house
near the Parson's Green end of Wandsworth Bridge Road.
As she left that house before Christmas, going to another
one near the Walham Green Town Hall, there is no need
to describe it. Neither need the Walham Green house be
described, since from there she went, in February 1897,
to yet another house, in a street off the Bishops Road, Fulham.
These and other removals did not necessitate the
use of a pantechnicon; a four-wheeler sufficed on each occasion.
Louie, the boy and the nurse went inside; the top
was quite big enough for her belongings. She stuck to the
south-western district; at no time did she move farther
east than when she took two rooms in Cheyne Walk, over a
bicycle shop near the Chelsea suspension bridge&mdash;which
rooms, by the way, she was forced to leave at an hour's
notice, her landlord, a man of straw, being himself ejected
and involving his sub-tenant in his own catastrophe. She
kept to this district because of its nearness to Kingston and
the Molyneux Arms. By the time the boy was nine
months old she was living in Tadema Road, not far from
where the Chelsea power-station now stands.</p>

<p>The nurse whom she had engaged was a link&mdash;save for
Chaff the only one&mdash;with Trant. She was, indeed, her
own old French governess, once Céleste Martin, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Céleste Farnier and a widow. She was a Provençale,
from Arles. On the death of her husband, which had
taken place while Louie had been still at the home in Mortlake
Road, she had sought out Chaff with a sheaf of testimonials,
and by-and-by Louie had engaged her. She paid
her ten shillings a week, on the distinct understanding that
she must not hesitate to accept the first decent post that
offered. It was already plain that, even if Céleste could
have brought herself to leave the little girl to whom she
had taught the order of the personal pronouns in French,
her affection for Master Jim would have haled her back
again.</p>

<p>Louie changed her abode so frequently for one reason
and another. In perhaps a third of the cases the landladies
to whom she offered herself as a lodger found reasons
for asking her to leave when they saw that her letters
were addressed to "Miss Causton." Then, to save cab
fares, Louie began to make her position plain at the outset.
Sometimes this made a difference, sometimes none.
On the whole, London S.W. showed itself charitable or
merely indifferent. By May 1897 she was at another
house in Wandsworth Bridge Road.</p>

<p>She had not refused to accept, easily and as a loan, a
sum of money from Buck; but thrice she had well-nigh
quarrelled with Buck because she would accept it only as a
loan. Twice, for the same reason, she had had tussles with
Chaff. But money, until she should find something settled
to do, she must have. No doubt Richenda Earle would
have shaken her head and have pointed out that now Louie
not only had the Scarisbricks behind her, but a prosperous
publican also; but Louie, though she lived as frugally as
if she had to earn every penny, did not see why her boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
should go short while there was money to be had. She
took the sensible view of the matter, and borrowed, while
walking her shoes out and answering advertisements for
this, that and the other.</p>

<p>Up to the summer of '97 her occupations had been almost
as various as her addresses. She very soon discovered
that her Holborn training was of little use to her, and
she could not (as also she discovered) play the piano well
enough to give lessons. What she dreamed of, of course,
was a comfortable private secretaryship; no young woman
is so ill-trained or so incompetent but she fancies herself
good enough for a private secretaryship. Perhaps Uncle
Augustus might have helped her to one, but she would
have nothing to do with Uncle Augustus; and Chaff was
unable to beat up anything of the kind. Buck's proposal,
that she should keep his books, had been the cause of their
second altercation. Common-sense in the matter of borrowing
she was prepared to be; beyond that point she remembered
her pride and Richenda's words. So for the
present she was spared the worst of the pinch.</p>

<p>So, in the early part of that year, she was in an A.B.C.
cash-desk, traveller for a History, and saleswoman at an
Earls Court chocolate-stall. Then, in June, she obtained,
actually in the face of considerable competition, a place in
the showrooms of a Bond Street photographer. Perhaps
her dresses, of which several still remained, helped her
to this place. She wrote letters, arranged appointments,
answered press and other calls on the telephone, and received
sitters. No doubt some of these knew Uncle Augustus.
Robson, of the Board of Trade (who came one
day), would probably know him; so would George Hastie,
Robson's friend and colleague, and perhaps Sir Peregrine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Campbell and others. Some of them, the more sporting
sort, might even know Buck too, for Buck was still a
tradition; in short, Louie's own position amused her immensely.
By taking her letters home with her and leaving
a younger assistant in charge, she was frequently able
to leave the showrooms by half-past four and to spend the
evenings with Céleste and her boy. Incidentally, Louie
improved her French a good deal, for Céleste crooned over
the boy in French and English indifferently.... "The
darleeng&mdash;the lo-ove&mdash;the précieux&mdash;oh, oh, oh, mais il
existe&mdash;il manifeste, le petiot&mdash;&mdash;"; and she would break
off to sing, in a cracked voice, "Le Pont d'Avignon," or
some lullaby of Frédéric Mistral. She idolised the infant;
when he was put to bed she did not delay long to follow
him, for Louie, who had her work to do during the day,
must not be roused at night; and so Louie frequently sat
alone, writing her letters or wrapped in her own musings.
She received thirty-five shillings a week. Her job had
the appearance of a "permanency." In July she got a
"rise" of three shillings a week. She also got ten days'
holiday, the greater part of which she spent in the company
of her father. She was beginning to know what holidays
meant now.</p>

<p>On one of those days she had an unexpected little meeting
in Richmond Park. Céleste and the boy had gone on
by train, and she was walking. The meeting was with a
girl called Myrtle Morris, who, when Louie had kept the
confectionery stall at Earls Court, had sold cigarettes at
the stall adjoining. Miss Morris was accompanied by a
tall young man; she stopped to greet Louie, and the young
man walked slowly on. Myrtle asked Louie what she was
doing now. Louie told her. "And you?" she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I've gone back to my old trade," the girl said,
nodding towards her retreating companion. "Artists'
model. That's my present employer&mdash;Izzard."</p>

<p>"Who?" said Louie. The name seemed familiar.</p>

<p>"Billy Izzard. Know him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Louie. But she remembered now where
she had heard the name.</p>

<p>"Jolly clever painter," said the model authoritatively.
"Nice fellow too. Shall I call him?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I must be getting on," said Louie.
"Good-bye."</p>

<p>"So long. Come and look me up some time, won't
you? 25 Edith Grove."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Good-bye."</p>

<p>So that was Roy's friend! They had not gone down
with the yacht that had lain under the hill at Rainham
Parva. But she had only seen Mr. Izzard's back. For a
moment, but only for a moment, she thought of Roy; then
the sum-total of a long sequence of reveries returned to her
again.</p>

<p>Or rather, the factors that made that total returned. In
spite of her broodings late at night, when her letters were
written and Jimmy's food prepared for the night, she was
still unable to cast them up. Had she been asked to state
her relation now to Mr. Jeffries her attempt would have
been something like this:</p>

<p>"It's perfectly absurd, of course. There is no relation&mdash;nothing
that can properly be called a relation. How
can there be, with a man I don't see&mdash;haven't seen since
that queer party? I don't even know where he is or
what he's doing; he may be a commissionaire again for
all I know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but," she now answered herself, as if it had been
some form of a dialogue, "don't forget that other night, at
Mortlake Road, after Kitty'd gone."</p>

<p>She did not forget that night. She had told herself
that night that it was nonsense that she should love Mr.
Jeffries. Again she answered that critical objector within
herself.</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> nonsense after all! How <i>can</i> I? I suppose
I mean that if things had been different I might have
loved him. Moping about a man you never see is all very
well for a schoolgirl for a week or two, but not for grown
women, and mothers at that."</p>

<p>"Then you mean he's just the same to you as Buck
and Chaff?" the dialogue continued, as she walked.</p>

<p>"All I mean is that he might have been more."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you were to hear now that he'd broken
off with Kitty, and&mdash;you know&mdash;that other were to happen?"</p>

<p>She did know what she meant by "that other." It was
the most familiar of her thoughts. It was what in her
heart she was stilly waiting for&mdash;to learn one day that Mr.
Jeffries had broken off with Kitty and had become engaged
to Evie Soames. And at that point she always tried
to stop the dialogue. Beyond that point lay something
that she vaguely apprehended might be horrible.</p>

<p>She had no definite reason for supposing this horrible
thing to exist. The horror, indeed, was that it might
exist, and to entertain morbid thoughts about something
that merely might exist was neither pleasant nor wise.
But at times she could not forget the promise she had once
made to herself&mdash;that if anything unaccountable ever happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
to a certain young man she would know in what
quarter to look for the likely cause of it. And something
had happened. Part of what had happened she had had
from Miss Cora; "A lethal chamber&mdash;the nasty little
sewer-rat!" Miss Cora had said; and it had happened on
the eve of his wedding to Evie Soames. To commit
suicide had been the only thing to do.</p>

<p>And of course he had committed suicide....</p>

<p>Then that second voice within her tried to speak again.
"Remember," it said, "that this Mr. Jeffries, of whom
you can't help thinking when all's said and done, had suffered
innumerable insults from him&mdash;you yourself were
dragged into one of them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quiet!" the other self commanded peremptorily.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and as far as that girl you hate's concerned&mdash;Evie
Soames&mdash;if the reason was good enough for suicide it was
good enough for the other thing."</p>

<p>"What other thing?" Louie, in spite of herself, could
not help asking.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;<i>you</i> know!"</p>

<p>"Do you know what you're saying?" This was an
attempt to browbeat the other Louie.</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly well! <i>I</i> know myself&mdash;you&mdash;us&mdash;Louie
Causton&mdash;better than you do! And I know that
lion better! Have you forgotten? Don't you remember
what you thought of him, that if he set his mind on a
thing he'd get it sooner or later, one way or another?
Don't you remember what he said&mdash;'I wonder if anybody's
ever beaten who doesn't deserve to be?' They are
dangerous men who believe that! And the way's clear
for him now, isn't it? Of course it is! Why, suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
you hear, first, that he's thrown Kitty Windus over; suppose
you hear, next, that he's forging ahead in his business,
whatever it is&mdash;you know he's as ambitious as Satan;
then suppose you hear that he's engaged to Evie Soames&mdash;married
to her. Suppose you hear all this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anybody can make up an <i>a priori</i> tale like that!"
the other scoffed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they can; but what <i>is</i> a murder anyway?
Whoever sees one committed? Don't they hang men on
just such <i>a priori</i> tales, as you call it? Suppose that,
rather than let him marry that girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop, stop!" Louie positively shrieked within
herself.</p>

<p>She was white. This scene always turned her white.
She quickened her pace, but her ghastly pallor remained
unchanged. A hundred times she had argued it all before,
and she knew the conclusion that would presently
come.</p>

<p>It came, the conclusion. That portion of herself that
always seemed resolved to convict Mr. Jeffries of a hideous
thing spoke, as it were, softly, seductively.</p>

<p>"And what then, Louie? What then? Come, don't
be afraid of yourself! You know it in your heart all the
time! Roy&mdash;you remember&mdash;<i>you</i> had to make the love
there; and you want to be <i>made</i> love to, not to make love.
<i>You</i> didn't find Mr. Jeffries a butt and a laughing-stock,
you know. You envied that little chit of a milliner's
hand&mdash;envied her and hated her. And she hates you, and
always will, because you caught her in the dark with that
other creature. Yes, yes, I know you were overstrung at
that time, and didn't see yourself very clearly, but look
at the thing now&mdash;you're calm now. When you saw his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
eyes, all full of perils and stratagems and deceits, all for
her sake, you know you longed to have a man do all that
for <i>you</i>! And when he did that mad thing with Kitty
Windus, you know you wanted a man who would go even
to those lengths for <i>you</i>! And you know that when he
throws her over&mdash;brutally, heartlessly, without conscience&mdash;you'll
want a man who'll be just as brutal and heartless
and conscienceless for <i>you</i>! You all want it! You
all love a ruthless man! You know it's the men who are
the merciful sex when sex comes into the question; you're
only merciful when it doesn't&mdash;just as those stupid men
are merciless about the abstractions you don't care a
straw about!... So suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop!" Louie besought herself faintly.</p>

<p>"&mdash;suppose it turns out as I say! Won't you immediately
love him a little more when poor Kitty's sent about
her business? And won't you love him a little more still
when you hear he's engaged to Evie Soames? And won't
you, when you learn that he's been willing to go all lengths&mdash;all
lengths&mdash;for love, love him past all mending? You
will, you will, you know you will!" The cry rang out
almost exultantly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;those people&mdash;coroners' juries&mdash;are supposed
to know all about these things."</p>

<p>"Coroners' juries!... Do you remember his eyes?..."</p>

<p>Beyond that point Louie never got. She usually rose
quickly and went out to post the photographer's letters.
There, then, were the elements of her sum. Sometimes
some of them presented themselves, sometimes others;
more and more she shrank from casting the total. And
often, to shake off the hideous, fascinating obsession, she
did the most trivial thing she could think of&mdash;went to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
drawer and overhauled her dresses, selecting the one she
would wear at the photographer's showroom on the morrow.</p>

<p>It was in her to turn from the thought of a possible
murder to the shaking out of a crumpled dress.</p>

<p>But she never wore the oyster-grey at the showrooms in
Bond Street. Nevertheless she shook it out frequently,
putting it back into the drawer again.</p>

<p class="p2">That day, at the Molyneux Arms, Buck was alternately
at his fondest and at his most tyrannical. The fondness
was for Louie and the boy, the tyranny for everybody else.
As Louie entered the little private parlour (she was not
allowed to set foot in the rest of the premises) she heard
loud crowings; they came from Jimmy, and were for the
Pilgrim of Love who held him up at arm's-length in the
air; but the next moment Buck was scolding a barmaid who
had had the temerity to borrow the current number of
<i>Modern Society</i> before Louie had seen it. "Not that I
don't make 'em all read it," he said, "but at times and
seasons, and in their proper places; what with all these
Radicals and what not we don't want chayoss coming
again! You bring it back this minute, miss!&mdash;'Oryn&mdash;thia
my Belovèd!"</p>

<p>Buck kept his divided humour through tea; then there
was another outburst. This time it was about a letter
that had not been given to Louie immediately.</p>

<p>"And how do <i>you</i> know that it isn't important?" he
broke out on his wife. "Not a word&mdash;not a word! I
<i>know</i> it is important&mdash;all letters addressed so are important,
mind, for the future! Those letters aren't about the
butcher and baker and candlestick-maker, I'll have you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
know! Give it to her at once, and let Madermoselle
hook up the back, or your next dress shall fasten down
the front, I promise you!... What, little man! A
granddad, eh? 'No re-(<i>h</i>)-est&mdash;but the gra-(<i>h</i>)-ave&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>For all Louie was able to guess from the signature, her
letter might have been from butcher, baker and candlestick-maker,
all three; the name&mdash;"hers to serve, Frank
Hickley"&mdash;was unknown to her. But the single other
name that the letter contained was known. It was that of
Kitty Windus. She was laid up somewhere in Vauxhall,
and wanted to see her.</p>

<p>The next morning, in a shabby respectable street off the
Vauxhall Bridge Road, Louie rang a bell beneath which,
punched in a strip of aluminium, was the sign, "F. Hickley,
Agent." F. Hickley himself opened the door. Later
Louie learned that he was an agent for his wife's shopping,
boot-cleaning and potato-peeling. Mrs. Hickley was
Kitty's cousin, but the bit she had coming in was not
enough to relieve her of the necessity of keeping a lodging-house.
That it was a lodging-house Louie guessed from
the number and variety of hats and coats that hung in the
narrow yellow-painted hall. Mrs. Hickley appeared from
somewhere below; Mr. Hickley, descending again, passed
her on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Are you Miss Causton?" Mrs. Hickley asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I've had a letter saying Miss Windus was
here."</p>

<p>"Will you come up? Don't take too much notice of
her, what she says, especially about tracts; Uncle Arthur's
side's liable to it. This way."</p>

<p>"Is she ill?" Louie asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"Not to call ill. She'll go to Margate in a week or
two, for the air, though Margate's too strong for me;
Littlehampton's my favourite. And Bognor. Mind the
stair-rod&mdash;I must tell Frank to fasten it down."</p>

<p>As Kitty had formerly found Louie, so Louie now
found Kitty&mdash;in bed. Her muteness as long as Mrs.
Hickley remained in the room seemed obstinate, <i>voulu</i>;
the rapid speech into which she broke without preface
when her cousin's step had ceased to sound on the stairs
confirmed some vague impression of secretiveness. Louie
was uneasy at the change in her.</p>

<p>"You're not to talk about it," Kitty said, the words
falling one over the other; "that's what the doctor meant,
though of course he didn't know what it was. And Mr.
Folliott too&mdash;the Reverend Mr. Folliott of St. Peters.
He gave me the address in Cliftonville, quite the best end
of the town; there's such a lot in a good address, don't you
think? You know Margate?"</p>

<p>"How are you, dear?" said Louie gently. "Yes, your
cousin told me you were going away for a bit."</p>

<p>"Right away," said Kitty. "I can, you see; I haven't
got to work if I don't want to; though I'm not rich, of
course. Neither is Annie, but I don't like to see men doing
the housework like Cousin Frank for all that. I've
told Frank so again and again. '<i>Be</i> an agent,' I've said
time after time; 'for typewriters, or mangles, or tea, or
anything you like, but get out of the house; it isn't a
man's place.' And it isn't.... You've heard?" she
broke off suddenly to say.</p>

<p>She blinked at Louie. Her neck above her nightgown
was hardly more substantial than that of a chicken; her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
hands seemed to have become as veined as a skeleton leaf.
Louie took one of them.</p>

<p>"Always running errands and setting the table&mdash;it
isn't a man's life," Kitty continued. "'What does agent
<i>mean</i>?' I said to him. 'Pull yourself together and <i>make</i>
it mean something, Frank!' I said. 'You're not very
big, but you're strong, and you've got your wits about
you,' I said.... You've heard?" she demanded once
more.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me how you are," said Louie, patting the
thin hand soothingly.</p>

<p>"But have you heard the news? Glad tidings for all.
'Come unto Me, and I will give you rest'&mdash;that's what we
all want&mdash;rest; though why they should print 'Come' in
red and 'unto' in green and 'Me' in purple, and all the
letters like twigs, I'm sure I can't tell you, my dear. And
always Oxford frames. I must ask Mr. Folliott.
'Though your sins be as crimson&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"You haven't asked how my little boy is, Kitty," said
Louie.</p>

<p>"'Suffer the little children, and forbid them not'&mdash;how
is he?"</p>

<p>But she did not wait for an answer. She was off
again&mdash;the doctor, the Reverend Mr. Folliott, her approaching
visit to Margate. And always she returned to
the indignity of a man's doing women's work about the
house. It was in this connection that she suddenly mentioned,
in a way that gave Louie a slight start, the name
of Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>"I will at least say that for him," she prattled; "I
shouldn't have got sick of the sight of him; out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
house at half-past nine he'd have been, and that would
have been the end of him till six o'clock; not always bumping
into you like Frank. I suppose you know Miss
Levey's there too, at his Company? He's getting on there
like anything. So's Mr. Mackie; you remember Mr.
Mackie? He takes the auction himself now on Mondays
and Thursdays; in Oxford Street; everybody stops as
they walk past; he's a caution, is Mr. Mackie, I can tell
you! But of course Jeff"&mdash;here she became mysterious,
and nodded once or twice&mdash;"Jeff's on the way up&mdash;up.
It's a different class of work from Mr. Mackie's; better, as
you might say; he's in the Confidential Exchange Department,
Miriam says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How is Miss Levey?" Louie asked, at a loss what
else to say.</p>

<p>"Oh, in the pink&mdash;but the soul's the chief thing; what
shall it profit a man; and I don't know whether her soul's
in the pink. Do you always <i>hold</i> with the Church of
England, Louie?" she asked earnestly.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be made of her. She ran on
weakly, irresponsibly, from trifle to trifle, and it was at
Louie's own risk that she gave her talk any significance at
all.... Suddenly she insisted that she herself had broken
the engagement, not he. She spoke of his place in the
Company&mdash;it was the Freight and Ballast Company; it
appeared to be a "permanency." He was getting on&mdash;on;
<i>he</i> wouldn't polish brasses and take the lodgers' boots to be
mended!... As she talked, Louie looked round the poor,
neat little bedroom. It had framed texts and a picture
of a lady shipwrecked in a nightgown; this was entitled
"Simply to Thy Cross I cling." There was a good deal
of muslin about, tied back with flyblown bows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>But suddenly Kitty seemed to remember something.
Louie was once more gently patting the hand on the
counterpane when she gave a quick little clutch and sat
up.</p>

<p>"They wrote to you to come, didn't they?" she asked,
looking hard at Louie.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. I'd have come sooner if I'd known. The
letter was sent on from Mortlake Road. I came as soon
as I got it."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Kitty, nodding mysteriously
again. "I want to talk to you. Is the door shut?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but don't talk. Let me talk to you instead."</p>

<p>"No; there's something I want to say, and I shall forget
it if I don't say it now.... You heard about it,
didn't you? I don't mean the glad tidings for all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lie down, dear." (Kitty was squatting up in bed.)
"Tell me the next time I come. I'll come again."</p>

<p>"No, I must tell you now. Though Jeff's sins be as
scarlet. Of course you heard about Archie?"</p>

<p>"Hush."</p>

<p>"Of course you'd be down on him; quite right; so was
Jeff. Jeff didn't half give him a talking to, I can tell
you! 'Oh, I'll give him a dressing down,' he said; he
was pretending it wasn't much, so as not to alarm me; but
<i>I</i> know him! 'Miss Causton and me?' he said. 'What
a ridiculous idea!' And he made Archie apologise before
the whole school. And now Archie's gone, and they
said it was suicide; but what I can't understand is about
Jeff's having that black eye, that very day. He'd fallen
when he was drunk, he said, but Jeff never got drunk.
He said he tripped on the step; but he never <i>got</i> drunk,
if you understand what I mean. Wine is a mocker, isn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
it, Louie? But I'm sure Jeff wasn't drunk. He isn't
that kind of man."</p>

<p>Louie herself wondered why she should interpose as
quickly and peremptorily as she did. She wondered, too,
why she should do so in the words she used and in a voice
so thin and harsh.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;of <i>course</i> he was drunk! My father keeps a
public-house, so I ought to know. And they often get
black eyes when they're drunk. Let's talk about something
else."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kitty, with her head on one side, "a
public-house is as paying a business as there is, especially
in a poor neighbourhood. But I'd rather have my little
bit in tramways. People ought to be careful how they
invest their money; dividends aren't everything; what
shall it profit a man? So you think I needn't worry about
Jeff's black eye?"</p>

<p>All at once Louie felt an almost hysterical need to turn
Kitty's weak wanderings into another direction&mdash;any other
direction. Glibly she began to improvise.</p>

<p>"It's horrid," she said, her voice a little raised. "I've
seen them at my father's. They get drunk, and fall, and
then they get black eyes quite easily. And," she ran on
regardlessly, "they knock themselves about fearfully!
I saw a man in the Harrow Road one night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Feverishly she extemporised. To something she had
once seen from the top of a bus she gave colour and circumstance.
Kitty was impressed. "Dear me!" she said.</p>

<p>Then, when the danger, whatever it was, seemed to be
averted, Louie turned, though not much more calmly, to
Margate. Kitty was perfectly docile; Margate or that
dangerous other were all the same to her. Louie had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
been to Margate, but she compared Margate with other
places&mdash;Bournemouth, Ilfracombe, Scarboro.</p>

<p>"I should like to go to Scarboro," Kitty mused&mdash;"Harrogate
too&mdash;Harrogate's tremendously toney, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Very; all hotels and kursaals and pump rooms and
things," averred Louie, who had never been to Harrogate
either.</p>

<p>Then, ten minutes later, she rose. She said good-bye.
But even as she did so she received another start. Kitty
had suddenly called in a sharp, loud voice.</p>

<p>"Was that Annie at the door?"</p>

<p>"No," said Louie, her nerves all on edge. "There's
nobody."</p>

<p>"Open the door and look!"</p>

<p>Louie did so. There was nobody. She returned to
the bed again. Kitty was once more squatting up. She
still spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"It's all very well to be so cocksure," she said, "but if
Annie was to guess, or Miriam Levey or any of them, it
would be all U P, I can tell you! Or Evie Soames either!
I only told you because you're different and can hold your
tongue! The tongue is a little member, so the best thing
people can do is to shut up, you take my tip! And <i>I</i>
broke it off, mind you! There's as good fish in the sea
as ever came out of it, without girls making themselves
cheap, and if he ever wants to know I'll tell him straight&mdash;no
drunks and black eyes for me! Not that I don't forgive
my enemies; I'm as good at that as the next one;
but when I'm engaged again it'll be to somebody who's
TT absolutely, though he does clean the knives!" Then,
dropping her voice again, she said equably: "Good-bye,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
dear&mdash;you will come again, won't you? I sha'n't be going
for a fortnight&mdash;the rooms aren't at liberty yet&mdash;there
isn't a sea view, but it isn't a minute from the Ramsgate
tram&mdash;you must come and stay with me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie left her. Downstairs in the hall she had a few
words with Kitty's cousin. She asked when the engagement
with Mr. Jeffries had been broken off, and was told
a year ago. Part of the time since then Kitty had spent
with another cousin, Alf Windus, who lived in Kilburn and
played the first fiddle at the Metropolitan in Edgware
Road; part she had spent at Alf's sister-in-law's at Wealdstone;
and for the rest of the time she had been at the
Hickleys'. She was only a little flighty at times, and Mrs.
Hickley was too busy, what with breakfasts at different
hours and some liking one thing and some another, to pay
much attention to her. She would have taken her for
nothing if she could, but life was a struggle and business
was business, and Mrs. Hickley had been lucky enough
to let her room for the time she would be away at Margate.
If Kitty really had anything to keep from her
cousin, apparently (Louie concluded) she had kept it.
Probably Kitty's condition (Mrs. Hickley added) was a
result of the shock of Archie Merridew's suicide, coinciding
with her rupture with Mr. Jeffries. Beyond that
Mrs. Hickley minded her own business&mdash;plenty, too,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming," she said, opening the door
for Louie.</p>

<p>"I shall come again if I may," Louie replied.</p>

<p>Already she knew that she would go again&mdash;must go
again&mdash;though it was only when she had left the house
behind her that she began to ask herself why. Then
followed another dialogue. The critical Louie began it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what did I tell you? His engagement's off, and
he's getting on in his business. I'm right so far, eh?"</p>

<p>"Too right," the other Louie muttered. "Let it rest."</p>

<p>"Will it let you rest&mdash;that's the question! Well, what
do you want next&mdash;his engagement to Evie Soames?"</p>

<p>"I don't want anything. I've got my boy and my living
to earn. That fills my life."</p>

<p>"Then why are you going to see Kitty again? Come,
don't shirk it. You know why you're going. You're
going to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not!"</p>

<p>"You're going to protect him! If that poor creature
thinks she guesses, you're going to tell her the notion's
perfectly absurd! You're going to lie to her! If she has
weak fancies, you're going to see that they're just as wide
of the truth as they can be. Do you still deny what the
truth is? After whatever the tale is he's been telling about
drunkenness and a black eye? <i>Is</i> he that kind of man?
<i>Isn't</i> that just as likely as not to be one of his blinds? A
man has to be cunning, you know, to hoodwink a coroner's
jury, but somehow he seems to have done it."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"You mean you believe he hasn't done it? Then why
are you going to see Kitty again? Oh, don't pretend to
me! I tell you you're going to protect him. And why
are you going to protect him? (Ah, I didn't think of that
before, but I see it now!) You'll love him a little more
still just for that! You'll love him because you have his
safety in your hands. You'll keep it in your hands.
Even if you have to take Kitty to live with you, so that
you can watch her every spare moment, you'll take care she
never, never knows. You're planning it now. You're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
going to have a right in that man no other woman on
earth has, Evie Soames or anybody else. And you're
going to take him from Evie Soames too, if you can!"</p>

<p>The other attempted irony. "What, me? With my
story?"</p>

<p>"You only regret your story because it stands now in
your way of getting him! Would you marry Roy now
even if you could gain a kingdom by it? Why, you
wouldn't before, let alone now! What are you going to
see Kitty again for&mdash;to-morrow? We shall see! Your
nerves are all a-jump at this moment; you don't feel it
safe to leave here even for a few hours! And another
thing. Miriam Levey seems to be at his place, wherever
it is, and you're positively trembling about <i>that</i>!
While you're trying to worm things out of Kitty on the
one side, she'll be at the other&mdash;<i>you</i> know what she is!
So the first thing you'll do will be to find out exactly
what Kitty's got into her head."</p>

<p>But here the normal Louie temporarily triumphed.
"What a tale you're making up!" she laughed. "These
things simply do not happen. Actually, you're trying to
force it on me that I love a man simply because he's
committed a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not simply because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that I'm in love with a man who has committed
one. Tell that to the world, and see how you're
laughed at!... Oh no, it's too much. People don't do
it, especially when it's guesswork, pure and simple&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>So she triumphed. The other Louie held her peace.</p>

<p>But for all that she went to see Kitty again on the
morrow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p class="center b1 p2">II</p>

<p>It was an error of judgment that caused Louie to leave
the photographer's in Bond Street. The money she
owed to Buck and Chaff was on her mind; she saw that
Richenda Earle had been right; she was not yet out in
the open. She sought to diminish her indebtedness by
finding a better-paid post.</p>

<p>The opportunity presented itself. She obtained, at a
salary of three pounds a week, the coveted secretaryship.
Never mind to whom she became secretary; he is now a
renowned author; and Louie was with him for just a
fortnight. At the end of that time he offered to double
her salary. Louie's answer was to walk immediately out
of his house. She had now no job at all.</p>

<p>The story of the pinch shall be passed over lightly. The
boy did not feel it; it was she who tightened her belt.
Promising herself that it was for the last time, she borrowed
of Buck, and then removed to Edith Grove, taking
two small rooms in the same house as Myrtle Morris, the
model. But Myrtle had gone for the Christmas season
into pantomime, and as Louie was out all day, and asleep
when Myrtle returned at night, she saw little of her. She
would have gone into pantomime too, but she was too late,
and still hoped for something better. Of necessity
Céleste remained with her; Céleste kept the place going
with her needle. This was at the beginning of 1898.
February found her again in a cash-desk, this time at
Slater's. The desk had a mirrored panel in the front of
it that extended from the narrow counter to the floor, and
at first Louie wondered why clerks and shop-assistants put
down their money, stood back from the desk, and grinned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Then one day, when somebody else was inside the box, she
noticed the illusion. The head and shoulders of the girl
in the cage appeared to be continued downwards by the
trousers of a man. As she could not afford to throw up
her job, she continued to bear the grins disdainfully.
After her day's work she acquired from Céleste the art
of crochet. Her mats and table-centres and borders for
teacloths went in with Céleste's own work.</p>

<p>Her improved French enabled her to pass, in April,
from the cash-desk at Slater's to one at a foreign restaurant
in Soho. She still lived in Edith Grove. For several
weeks that summer she was again at Earls Court,
but with the reopening of the theatres she obtained a
place in the ladies' cloakroom at His Majesty's. One
night she helped Miss Elwell, the daughter of Sir James
Elwell of the Treasury, off with her cloak. She was unrecognised.
She wondered how B. Minor was getting on.</p>

<p>She was still at His Majesty's at Christmas 1898; but
the New Year saw her at still another place&mdash;a Ladies'
Turkish Baths, in St. James's. Buck, angry and disapproving
of the whole course of her life, liked this least
of all; massage somehow brought it home to him. But
there was a worse shock still in store for Buck. In the
spring of '99 Louie became an artist's model.</p>

<p>Myrtle Morris introduced her to the profession and to
Roy's friend, Billy Izzard, at the same time. This also
was in Edith Grove. Billy Izzard, whose large, boyish
face and loose, shambling figure somehow gave Louie the
impression that he had either grown too quickly or else
not yet filled out, was telling Miss Morris, with a candour
entirely disarming, that for some purpose or other her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
own form was no good at all; and Miss Morris asked him
why he didn't try the Models' Club. He snorted.</p>

<p>"Try it? I have tried it; tried everything. Fact of
the matter is, it's like going to a Registry Office for servants;
you find the rich people have snapped up all the
best before they get there. Old Henson gets 'em. He's
got the very girl I want; Miss Gale; but I can't pay what
Henson pays. And the rest of you are like that egg&mdash;good
in parts."</p>

<p>Louie wondered whether Billy had ever heard her name
before; she found a way of making sure. The talk
turned to holiday-places for the coming summer, and
Louie contrived to mention the Somerset coast and the
Bristol Channel. The unsuspecting Billy told her that
he had once been yachting there with a fellow and had
had a smash-up. It was amusing. According to Billy,
the other fellow had rather fancied himself as a patcher-up
of broken centre-boards and suchlike, had put in at some
place or other, and had said he'd made the centre-board
all right; and he'd come pretty near drowning the pair
of them off a place called Combe Martin. Luckily they'd
been spied by the coastguard, and a boat had been put out
to them. "Rottenest piece of navigation in England,"
Billy grumbled on; "there's a place called the Boiling
Pot&mdash;&mdash;" He described it....</p>

<p>Louie felt a little gush of gratitude towards Roy. He
had not chattered. But of course he would not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She did not offer at once to sit to Billy; it was a fortnight
later that she screwed up her courage to do so.
During that time she thought the matter out. Perhaps
the stark simplicity of the thing attracted her. No acquirement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
she was ever likely to possess would greatly
improve her circumstances; it would probably be the same
to the end of the chapter&mdash;cash-desk, waitress, Earls
Court&mdash;Earls Court, mannequin, and a private secretaryship
with an offer of double wages. At two colleges she
had learned little or nothing; she lacked application; but
here was something that quietly brushed acquirements
aside&mdash;something that went flagrantly by favour. It was
femininity reduced to its simplest statement. She had
no fear of Billy Izzard. She guessed that to him she
would be little more than a more complex whitewashed
cube or cone or pyramid.</p>

<p>She did not even colour when she made her proposal to
him....</p>

<p>"But I expect you'll go off to old Henson or some
other swell presently," he sighed, as she stood before
him....</p>

<p>And of course Chaff, barring her face that was best
suited with a large shady hat, had given her her testimonial
long before.</p>

<p>Buck was furious. The original, genuine Pilgrim of
Love had reason enough to know what happened in
studios. Young women of high birth (in Louie's case
it would probably be a young man) began to take their
lunches there, and one day burst into jealous unhappy
tears, and after that the Pilgrimage began. But Louie
only laughed at him. She reminded him that she had
reason to regard herself as a pilgrim too. At that Buck
looked hard at her.</p>

<p>"Little woman," he said slowly, "d'you mean&mdash;that
there is somebody?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Louie laughed again, but more consciously.</p>

<p>"Once or twice lately," Buck continued, still looking
hard at her, "I've wondered whether there might
be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can there be, daddy?"</p>

<p>"Well, the other isn't befitting," said Buck, shaking his
head and returning to the original point.</p>

<p>"My daddy did it."</p>

<p>"Ah, men's different. For high ladies it&mdash;it isn't befitting."</p>

<p>"I'm not a young girl, daddy."</p>

<p>"No." Buck sighed. If he had only known her when
she was a young girl! But the whims of the Scarisbricks
were still the Scarisbricks' whims, and as such above his
judgment. "But I want to see this Mr. Izzard," he
added grimly.</p>

<p>"That you certainly sha'n't," Louie replied promptly.
"Fancy your taking me round everywhere I go!"</p>

<p>"Everywhere?" Buck repeated, alarmed anew.</p>

<p>"Of course. If it's a business it's a business. Why,
Mr. Izzard alone would be&mdash;dreadful! It's no good,
daddy; you can't change my mind."</p>

<p>He saw that he could not, but he still tried. It only
delayed a little her carrying of her point. In the end&mdash;well,
she was her mother's daughter. There was no more
to be said.</p>

<p>So she began to make the round of the Chelsea studios,
and presently moved, with Céleste and the boy, to more
comfortable quarters in Lavender Hill, Clapham Junction.
This took her farther from her work in Chelsea, but
brought her nearer to the Lambeth and Westminster
Schools of Art, where also she obtained sittings, sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
during the day, sometimes in the evenings also.
She sat for Billy when Billy could afford to pay her.
"No, no&mdash;no tick, Billy," she told him once; "I don't
do this for amusement." Of the boy Billy knew nothing....
Buck, still strongly averse from the whole proceeding,
at first refused to hear her gossip of the day's
work; but, as his silence did not alter matters, little by
little he began to come round. Soon they exchanged experiences
quite freely. He told her what Sopley had
said about his deltoid, Henson about his thigh. "You
vain old daddy!" she said, stroking his cheek, "I believe
for two pins you'd do it again!" She took a pleasure in
fondly shocking him in the same sort. Sometimes he
mused long. You will admit that it was something to
muse over. And so&mdash;well, so Louie, throwing acquirements
aside with her clothes, became, by virtue of her
peculiar commodity, economically emancipated. As female
models, women are eminently better than men.</p>

<p>She did fairly well at it. So well did she do that from
the three rooms in Lavender Hill (the third one Céleste's)
piece by piece her landlady's furniture began to disappear.
Her own took its place. She intended, when she had
enough of her own, to save the difference in rent between
furnished and unfurnished quarters by taking a small flat.
So her two chests of drawers and her wardrobe were her
own; so were much of her cutlery and bed and table linen;
and so, of course, were Jimmy's various paraphernalia.
But she was not ready to leave yet. The summer of 1900,
she thought, would be early enough.</p>

<p>And in one particular at least she was now able to hold
up her head. She still owed money both to Buck and
Chaff, but she knew as much about the struggle for a livelihood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
as Richenda Earle herself. And she had not
grizzled. Life had not knocked her out. She was her
father's daughter after all.</p>

<p>And yet, once more, she felt herself her mother's daughter
too. The reason, which was not very far to seek, was
this:</p>

<p>The earlier stages of that furtive romance that in the
end had left her former husband no Rest but the Grave
were known only to Mrs. Chaffinger herself. Henson had
not guessed them; Lord Moone had seen only the resultant
scandal of them. But Louie understood a little now.
She could at least guess what had happened to her mother
between her first setting eyes on the splendid Buck and
that final petulant, pathetic cry: "Oh, that I should have
to beg a man to marry me!" By sympathy she was able
now to divine the sighs, the half-acknowledged longings,
the half-shamed daydreams, the revulsions, the sinkings
back again. For Louie now knew something of these
things within herself.</p>

<p>Not that there was not harder stuff in Louie. There
was. There was, for example, that sense of proportion
which is humour. How could her thoughts of Mr. Jeffries
not be rather preposterous? She found it difficult
sometimes to remember even his personal appearance; she
had well-nigh forgotten his voice; many idle repetitions
had dulled the memory of that odd little thrill she had felt
when her hand had lain in his. True, she remembered
these things in a way. She remembered the tawny bulk
of him, the lion's eyes, the gloss of his hair, the modeless
fashion of his speech; but these were mere noted
facts, no more hers than everybody else's. Yet what (she
asked herself) had become of her sense of humour that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
should want something of him that nobody else had?
What had happened to her sense of proportion that she did
not forget him as she had forgotten scores of people of
whom she had seen far, far more? And how had it come
about that, for one thought she cast on Roy, Mr. Jeffries
had twenty? And why this new and curious understanding
of her mother?</p>

<p>She asked herself these questions behind the grilles of
her cash-desks, behind the counters of her Earls Court
stalls, posing or crocheting on her model thrones, riding
backwards and forwards to her sittings or what not on
the tops of omnibuses. Usually she answered herself
more or less like this:</p>

<p>"It looks very much as if I was making of him what
he seems to have made of that Soames girl&mdash;a sort of <i>idée
fixe</i>; if I were to fall really in love now, I suppose I
shouldn't think any more about him. Luckily it doesn't
matter; it's my own affair. Good gracious, suppose he
knew! He'd think me as imbecile as I am!&mdash;There I go
again!" (This probably, some minutes later.) "Suppose
I <i>had</i> met him earlier, and things <i>had</i> been different&mdash;what
about it? What's the good of remembering
all that now? Well, it puts the time on down this beastly
Kennington Lane.... Thank goodness I'm not likely
to come across him; I can't help thinking something
would happen if I did.... Poor mother!" she usually
ended inconsequentially, "I suppose she'd be about my
age. I'm turned thirty&mdash;thirty-one in fact&mdash;shall have to
stop counting soon. Time you stopped counting when it
occurs to you that your mother had dreams just as silly as
yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so, whether this Mr. Jeffries meant much or little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to her, he did not mean so much but that any trivial near
occurrence&mdash;a cold of young Jimmy's, a cold of her own
that prevented her from sitting for a day or two, or a fall
in the crochet-market&mdash;put Mr. Jeffries and the wild and
tangled ideas that seemed to cloak his image temporarily
quite out of her thoughts.</p>

<p class="p2">When early in the year 1900 she got regular sittings for
a time with an artist who lived in St. John's Wood, she
never went up or down Tottenham Court Road in the
Victoria bus without half expecting to run across Evie
Soames, who lived in Woburn Place. Because she did not
meet her, she concluded that very likely she lived there no
longer. But, late on a windy afternoon in March, at
about the time when the street lamps were being lighted,
she did meet her.</p>

<p>It was opposite the Adam and Eve, in Euston Road,
and on either of the two women's parts there was a curious
momentary hesitation. If Evie Soames still lived in
Woburn Place and was going home, the first bus that came
would do for her, and Louie had already seen her glance
as it approached; but as it happened, that bus was the
Victoria bus for which Louie herself was waiting. Louie
spoke; it seemed to her that not to speak would be to
apologise, by silence, for that episode in her career that
had brought Kitty Windus in haste to the Nursing Home
in Mortlake Road. A large parcel she was carrying gave
her an excuse not to shake hands.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said.</p>

<p>Something, she could not have told what, had instantly
drawn her eyes to the girl's attire. Evie Soames was
wearing a black jacket and black fur cap, but the wind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
turning the jacket aside, showed the narrow black and
white stripes of the blouse beneath.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;fancy meeting you!" Evie said, turning her
dark eyes as if she had only that moment seen Louie.
There was something in her manner that Louie interpreted
as meaning, "Very well, if I've got to be cordial I'll <i>be</i>
cordial!" "Are you going by this bus?" she added.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! Where are you living now&mdash;Putney?"</p>

<p>It may be that Louie met any slight the last word might
have conveyed half-way and more. She replied, a little
shortly: "No, Lavender Hill; I change at Victoria.
After you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;after you!"</p>

<p>Louie ascended; they couldn't stand on the kerb discussing
points of precedence. "Let's go in front," Evie
said, "and then men won't smoke on us," and they settled
down.</p>

<p>"Well," Evie said, adjusting the apron, "and how are
<i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Louie, "perfectly well."</p>

<p>"There's room for your parcel here. Such ages since
we met! Let me see, when was it?"</p>

<p>They discussed when it was, and then, "And have you
seen Kitty Windus lately?" Evie asked.</p>

<p>Since her first visit to the Hickleys' Louie had seen
Kitty perhaps half-a-dozen times in all, not oftener.
Kitty had been to Margate, thence to Whetstone, and
after that to Alf Windus the violinist's. Louie had simply
not been able to see her oftener; she had had far too
much to do. And, after all, nothing (the nothing of
Louie's fears and fancies) seemed to have happened. Except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
to herself (Louie guessed) Kitty made no mysterious
allusions to black eyes. She was merely puzzled, pathetic,
harmless. She had not that perilous thing, a preconceived
theory into which events had a fulfilling way of
dropping of themselves. So Louie replied to Evie Soames
in a tone as casual as her own:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I've seen her several times. Of course you
heard that her engagement to Mr. Jeffries was broken
off?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Evie, looking straight in front of her.</p>

<p>"Have you seen her, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. But of course Mr. Jeffries himself would
know, wouldn't he?&mdash;that is, if you call it breaking off
when a person just disappears without saying where she
is or anything about it. Don't bother to unbutton; I have
some pennies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Louie also had pennies. "Any more fares?" the
conductor called, and then went downstairs again. The
two women fell into a silence. The early lamplight came
and went on their faces as the bus jogged on.</p>

<p>Presently the silence seemed to have taken almost the
character of a contest as to who should speak next, with
either resolved that it should not be herself. Louie knew
perfectly well what was the matter. Miss Soames might
speak glancingly of Mortlake Road and offer to pay her
bus fares, but really she hated Louie because of Louie's
discovery in the old ledger-room on that examination day
that now seemed so long ago. The girl seemed to be still
in some sort of half mourning&mdash;but Louie did not want to
think much of that and all that it might mean. Rather
desperately, she strove to forget that she had ever had a
theory about what might have driven Evie Soames into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
black and of what might happen when she went into colours
again. She must, she told herself sharply, have a hideous
mind ever to have thought these things. Indeed, she was
so short with herself about it that, relinquishing the contest
of silence, she again made the small immediate thing
banish the large shadowy one behind.</p>

<p>"Do you ever see Miriam Levey nowadays?" she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," Evie replied. At any rate she had not been the
first to speak.</p>

<p>"Oh? But aren't she and Mr. Jeffries at the same
place now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe they are&mdash;in fact, I know they are. I
suppose Kitty told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Poor Kitty! But let me see: was Miriam at the
office when Kitty came to Mortlake Road? I thought it
was after that she went."</p>

<p>"I've seen Kitty more than once," said Louie, compressing
her lips. The bus was slowing down opposite
the Oxford.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, you said so. Well, remember me to her
when you see her again, won't you? I get down here. I
hope you'll get your parcel home all right; it's rather a
large one, isn't it? Good-bye."</p>

<p>As Evie Soames's figure was lost in the crowd that
jostled in the lights of the Horse Shoe Louie did not look
round. She was too angry. "Good gracious!" she exclaimed,
"the insupportable little creature! Why, I
never looked at one of my mother's housemaids so! <i>De
haut en bas</i>&mdash;her to me! But I did catch you that day,
Miss Polly Ross, and you know it!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>But as the bus moved southwards again, she was trying
once more to forget that white stripe in Evie Soames's
dress. She did not want to think that anything had suddenly
seemed to come a stride nearer. And she would
now rather not have been told, what apparently was the
fact, that, whether frequently or not, Evie Soames did see
Mr. Jeffries.</p>

<p>The parcel she was taking home contained a dress; she
had been sitting in it; but it was not the oyster-grey.
The old oyster-grey, too, served to bring her nearer to her
mother and that weak flicker of romance long ago in
Henson's studio. Not for worlds would she have had
Céleste see the idiotic looks she sometimes gave that dress
in which she had danced with Mr. Jeffries. And sometimes
she would suddenly toss it aside, roughly, anyhow.
She was not seventeen (she would tell herself), to moon
over a flower a man had given her or a dance programme
on which he had scrawled his name. She was a woman
of turned thirty-one (she rubbed it in), with her living
to earn and an illegitimate son to provide for.... But
sometimes she was very wistful too. She had never (she
sighed) really been a girl of seventeen at all; looking
back, she saw that she had missed that. She blamed nobody;
no doubt she had been unruly, ill-conditioned, unmanageable;
still, she had missed that. The thought always
sent her off into her reveries again; and then, how
differently, how much more admirably, she was able to
plan everything to herself! Over and over again she built
it all up, unbuilt it again, rearranged it, played with it.
Had she, as a girl of seventeen, met Mr. Jeffries&mdash;had
this circumstance been different, that particular not been
the same&mdash;had she nursed no grudge against her mother&mdash;had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
it been Mr. Jeffries, not Roy, with whom she had
kicked her long legs during the vacations at Mallard
Bois&mdash;had she, in a word, had the arranging of the world
herself and the choosing of the places she and he were to
occupy in it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bosh!" she usually cut herself abruptly off. "I shall
be afraid of turning a corner soon for fear of walking into
the gentleman! What shall I take in for supper?"</p>

<p class="p2">She did not know yet&mdash;indeed it was only some months
later that she learned it, but it is set down here&mdash;that already,
at a Langham Exhibition, Billy Izzard had one day
seen a big stranger standing before one of his sketches, had
gone up and spoken to him, and had liked the fellow&mdash;had
liked his hewn slab of a face with the yellow eyes in it so
much that presently, having an old sketch he was never
likely to sell, he had given it to him. But Billy would
at any time rather give away a sketch to somebody he
liked than sell one to somebody he didn't like, and he still
set, moreover, less than their real value on those paintings
of flowers that he "knocked off" in a couple of keen and
nervous hours. One of these sketches, by the way, Louie
herself coveted&mdash;a straggle of violets, a few white ones
among them, in a lustre bowl; and she offered a certain
number of sittings in exchange for it&mdash;another elementary
example of the transaction in kind. But Billy shook his
head. He wanted that for a wedding present for a fellow,
he said. He'd give Louie another some time&mdash;after
he'd found another studio. He was sick of Chelsea; when
a fellow got to know the cracks in the flagstones it was
time he moved. He thought of going up north somewhere,
Camden Town or Hampstead or St. John's Wood&mdash;better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
air. So Louie could make up her mind to the bus-rides,
or else move too. He wasn't going to let Henson get
hold of her.</p>

<p>But Louie still delayed to move from Lavender Hill.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">III</p>

<p>Louie's adventures, as she continued to sit, would
fill a book: but not this book. Her sittings were the
accidents of her life; her real life she reckoned from Sunday
to Sunday. Sundays were the blest days she devoted
to Jimmy.</p>

<p>He was now nearly four years old, and (as Céleste continued
delightedly to exult) "existed" and "manifested"
indeed. Louie herself gave him her bath before she set
out of a morning; she did so in a waterproof and little
else&mdash;why, the splashed condition of the wall-paper in the
poky little bathroom explained. It was the same old waterproof
she had worn at Rainham Parva. Buck's admiration
of the boy's chest and limbs was merely fatuous; he himself
was teaching him to swim at the Public Baths. He had
announced to Louie, with a great show of harshness, that
the money she was fool enough to refuse, the boy would
have the benefit of; that at least was something she
couldn't prevent, he informed her, and though Louie
scolded fondly back, it was a weight off her mind. Chaff,
the other grandfather, came occasionally on Sundays; he
came, for example, on the Sunday after the opening of the
Royal Academy. He brought a catalogue with him, and,
taking Louie into a corner, desired her to mark the numbers
for which she had sat. Whether the poor old fellow
meditated the buying of them all up, or what else, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
was no telling. Her sittings, too, were "just like Mops."
Perhaps that was more than some of the pictures were.</p>

<p>But it is not true, as has been reported, that for Henson's
last picture, "Resurgam," Buck Causton and his
daughter posed together. Buck never posed after his
first marriage. Louie only posed for Henson once, and
that was in wet drapery. She caught a pretty cold in consequence.
She exulted in that cold; it gave her three
whole days with little Jimmy. They played with tops and
balls and soldiers on the floor. The boy wanted an ensign's
uniform, like that of the fourth Lord Moone in the
miniature, and Chaff bought him a dragoon's helmet and
cuirass. Buck laughed because the cuirass was already
too small; and then he sighed. Perhaps he remembered
the suit of armour of Big Hugo at Mallard Bois.</p>

<p>Well, if a little money was all that was necessary, the
boy could be put into the army by-an-by.</p>

<p>And so things might have gone on had they been destined
to do so; but into Louie's life of busy sitting and foolish
dreaming and Sunday's rompings with her boy, there
came a disruptive force. Kitty Windus brought it on a
Sunday morning in early June.</p>

<p>Céleste was reading a story to Jimmy when she walked
in; Louie was putting the last touches to a piece of crochet;
and all three were awaiting Buck's arrival with the trap&mdash;he
was going to take them to Hampton Court. She entered
unannounced, and, to Louie's way of thinking, would
have been better in bed. Her face seemed unusually small
and thin; she spoke in a high, painful voice.</p>

<p>"Louie, I want to see you&mdash;quick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was as if Louie too caught an instant alarm. Hurriedly
she dropped her just-finished crochet and rose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked quickly. "Come into
my bedroom."</p>

<p>In the quite prettily furnished little bedroom Kitty began
to walk rapidly to and fro. Once or twice she turned
her looks to the brown-papered walls, as if she expected to
find texts there; for the rest the blinking little eyes roved
ceaselessly at about knee-height from the floor. Then she
stopped before Louie.</p>

<p>"They're getting married in a fortnight," she cried
harshly, accusingly.</p>

<p>There is no need for Louie to ask who, nor did she know
what instinct again, as before, bade her take up a definite
attitude without a moment's delay. She only felt in her
very bones that delay would be perilous, and that not the
shade of an expression must cross her face that was not
natural and unsurprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; didn't you know?" she said quietly.
"Mr. Jeffries and Evie Soames, you mean?"</p>

<p>Again Kitty made that painful little sound&mdash;<i>à bouche
fermée</i>. "You knew?" she cried.</p>

<p>A simple lie would not have availed; this was so obvious
that Louie lied deliberately, circumstantially and at length.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I knew. Of course I did. Do you
mean to say you didn't? I made certain you did; I was
going to write to you. In about a fortnight, isn't it?
I'm&mdash;I'm giving them a wedding present; it's&mdash;it's that
piece of crochet you saw me doing. It isn't much, but
these things don't go by value; it's the intention. What
are you going to give them?"</p>

<p>She almost blushed for the lameness of it. As a matter
of fact, she had intended that piece of crochet for the
new flat, when she should take it; but to soothe Kitty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
now was of more importance than crochet for new flats.
She watched her covertly, anxiously.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" Kitty flashed out, again stopping
in her walk.</p>

<p>"Sit down, dear; sit on the edge of my bed; I'm sure
you're tired. How did I know? Why, I saw Evie herself.
I saw her on a bus one day in Tottenham Court
Road. It was near the Adam and Eve. And&mdash;I say,
Kitty"&mdash;dropping her voice confidentially, she made an
appeal to Kitty's hunger for gossip&mdash;anything for a diversion&mdash;"I
doubt if they'll have too much to live on&mdash;it
takes a tidy bit to get married on&mdash;and I don't suppose
she has any shares to sell."</p>

<p>But Kitty did not seem to hear. She flashed out again.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"My <i>dear</i>! I made sure you'd heard it from Miriam
Levey. And I wasn't sure where you were; you move
about so, you know. I wonder what Miriam will give
them! Something far more expensive than mine, I expect.
And you ought to give them something too, Kitty.
What's done's done, you know, and after all, lots of engagements
are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But once more Kitty flashed out. "Oh, <i>I</i> shall give
him a bottle of arnica, or whatever it is, for black eyes!"</p>

<p>Louie laughed almost hysterically at the joke. The
tension was getting almost too much for her. "Oh, come,
he isn't a wife-beater yet!" she protested.</p>

<p>"But he will be, that man!" Kitty cried aloud with
frightening vehemence. "He'd do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;much
he cares! Did you know I got lost the other
night? In Lincolns Inn Fields; policemen coming up to
me, if you please, and asking me where I lived! Much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
he cares! I believe it was her all the time&mdash;he never
wanted me at all, and as soon as Archie's out of the way
he goes and marries her! Miriam Levey herself says she
can't help thinking it's funny&mdash;and I can't think what
<i>your</i> game is either, to be going on as if it wasn't! I'll
tell you what <i>I</i> think, if you want to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, hush!" came from Louie. She had her
arms about Kitty. "Perhaps you're right, dear; he was
cruel to you! And"&mdash;she rushed into another
extemporisation&mdash;"I don't know that I would give him a present,
after all. If one can't forgive an injury one can't,
and it's no good pretending. He did wrong you, and
perhaps he oughtn't to be let off, after all. I won't send
him one either."</p>

<p>She said it because it was better to confine Kitty to her
own wrongs than to allow her to approach a number of
frightening unknown possibilities that began with black
eyes. And apparently she succeeded. Kitty fell back on
her own injury, and became a little calmer.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said cunningly, "but you'd have to send
yours, and Miriam Levey'd have to send hers too&mdash;then,
don't you see, I should be the only one who didn't, and
he'd notice it! I just hope he does notice it. Serve him
right. I wasn't as hard up for a fellow as all that&mdash;I carried
on with a fellow at that breaking-up party. I did&mdash;you
ask Mr. Mackie.... You <i>do</i> think Jeff never intended
to marry me at all, don't you, Louie?" She peered
curiously at Louie.</p>

<p>Well, better that, Louie thought. "I don't think he
meant to for a single moment," she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, the <i>rotter</i>. Come on, let's send your present
now. We'll show him!..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>She was quite eager about it; but Louie kept her in the
bedroom a little longer. Kitty began to speak of texts
again. Again she wondered why "Come" was written in
green and "Unto" in red and "Me" in purple, and why
all texts had Oxford frames. "You haven't any, I see,"
she said, glancing again round the brown-papered walls.
"You ought to have 'Remember thy Creator,' you know,
Louie; it always reminds you, you see. What's this?"</p>

<p>It was one of Billy Izzard's etchings. Kitty examined
it with her head a little on one side.</p>

<p>"It's very nice, whatever it is," she conceded; "but
where's the other one? I always think pictures look
better in pairs. But you can get odd ones cheap sometimes;
Mr. Mackie had a great sale of Art Engravings one
day in one of those Oxford Street places&mdash;you can hear his
voice right across the street&mdash;and <i>he</i> said they were cheap
because they weren't pairs, but they'd do splendidly for
the middle of anywhere, like over a mantelpiece. And
what a nice looking-glass! Really, you're quite comfortable
here!"</p>

<p>She seemed to have forgotten all about Mr. Jeffries
again. She walked round Louie's bedroom, bestowing
encomiums and preening herself on her own pound a
week.</p>

<p>At midday Buck came, but Louie did not join the party;
she sent Céleste and Jimmy, and herself stayed with Kitty.
She hoped Kitty would not stay long; she wanted to lie
down and think&mdash;think. Nor did Kitty stay very long;
but before she went she returned to the subject of the
crochet. She wanted the article&mdash;it was a teacloth&mdash;sent
immediately; she would run out and post it herself, she
said; and <i>then</i>, when he got presents from Miriam and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Louie and none from herself, <i>that</i> would be rather a
nasty one for Mr. Jeffries!</p>

<p>"Do pack it up. <i>I'll</i> show him I'm not to be trampled
on like the dirt under his feet!" she persisted vindictively;
and another approach to the subject of black eyes
caused Louie to yield hurriedly. She folded the cloth
and found a piece of brown paper; Kitty did not notice
that she enclosed no message.</p>

<p>But suddenly Louie had an odd little hesitation. She
knew it to be ridiculous and a sentimentality, but while
she did not want to send a particular message, she yet did
not want to send the teacloth entirely without one. The
opportunity for the little secret luxury would probably
not occur again.... Kitty was condescendingly appraising
her furniture again; on the mantelpiece lay a piece
of blank card; it seemed to be there almost for a purpose,
and furtively Louie took it. She scrawled an "L" upon
it and slipped it into the parcel.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Kitty left, taking the wedding
present with her.</p>

<p>Left at last alone, Louie once more went into her bedroom
and threw herself on her bed. She lay with her
hands clasped behind her head, her gaze now resting on
Billy's etching, now straying idly over the brown-papered
walls.</p>

<p>So they were to be married. And after that?</p>

<p>Well, she thought that on the whole she was glad. The
curtain was about to fall on that drama that had begun
at the Business School in Holborn, and so there would be
an end of <i>that</i>.... What now? What about those
fancy pictures with which she had beguiled herself as she
had ridden on buses and trams and worked at her crochet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
during the rests? What about those half-whispered, nonsensical
conversations? What about those drowsy, secret
quarters of an hour out of which she had come with slight
starts to smile at herself? They were to be married.
What next?</p>

<p>The answer came as if for months it had been merely
awaiting her pleasure. It was as plain as day that she
could now have as much of these as ever she pleased.
For what it was worth, the freedom of her cuckoo-cloud-land
was about to be definitely made over to her. Because
nothing else was hers, that was all the more hers....
Kitty's tidings brought it so sharply home to her that she
forgot that those sweet hours of licence were no new thing.
She forgot that it was no new thing to walk, in fancy, the
woods of Mallard Bois and the lanes of Rainham Parva
with him by her side, no new thing to call his name down
the remembered glades&mdash;"Jim!" (not, as others called
him, "Jeff"). She forgot that it was old and outworn
already; she saw in it only newness and liberty and delight.
A Jim of sorts was now hers, ineluctably and for ever&mdash;a
Jim who did not fool predestined spinsters&mdash;a Jim who
would know better than blunder into a blind and stupid
marriage&mdash;a Jim whose relentless hand had not&mdash;had
not&mdash;had not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But here, as she paused, the colour that had made her
cheeks rosy ebbed as if a brush loaded with white had been
passed over them. His ruthless hand had&mdash;had&mdash;almost
certainly had&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was as if, in her fancy, a prison bell had tolled and a
black flag had been run up in the morning breeze&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was certainly a murderer; over the threshold of that
hideous fact she must step before she could enter her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
palace of insubstantial delights. Stained she must take
even the phantom of his hand, or not at all. Suppose the
joy were to leave her, but the horror to remain?</p>

<p>She closed her eyes.</p>

<p>But she opened them again. She faced it. Say he
was&mdash;that; what then? The joy and the horror were
fatally one. A man capable of all&mdash;all&mdash;even of that&mdash;and
her lover! Oh, the moment the shudder had passed
the worst was over! He had killed; yes, but for a cause!
He had been horribly to be feared; yes, but without the
dread of him too she would not have had the whole of him,
and she wanted the whole of him. <i>Not</i> kill, with such
a reason? Withhold death, with something approaching
that was worse than death? Oh, Louie knew all about
that; Miss Cora had told her....</p>

<p>A murder? There were things by the side of which a
murder, once you had made up your mind to it, was a
trifle!</p>

<p class="p2">Are women so? Is it so that they will place their soft
hands, like willow-leaves, in those other hands that may be
black with dreadful work, red with destruction, yet, seeing
less than man and more than man, they care not? Is it so
that they will set their lips, as if for a kiss, against the
mouth of war itself with its ten thousand deaths? It
seems to be so. Their loved ones, when they die, do not
do so of fevers and shattered tissues, but of their own clear
and trusted heroism. "Go," they say to the next one,
even to the little Jimmy, "go&mdash;and come back if you
may&mdash;and, though wooden props keep you together, you
shall be beautiful to the mother who bore you&mdash;to the wife
whose task it must be to take you to pieces and put you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
together again&mdash;to the woman who, because of her own
heavenly dreaming, cannot think of the fiend you were
in that hour when the call sounded and you dropped the
point of your lance to the charge."</p>

<p class="p2">But one thing was clear: her dreams must remain
dreams. If she would keep what was left her, she must
never, never, never see him now!</p>

<h2 class="p6">PART V<br />
THE CONSOLIDATION</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p class="center b1 p2">I</p>

<p>The habit of sitting for artists leaves its mark on a
woman. This mark is the lack of mystery&mdash;the
"looked at" appearance. But it has its compensations.
Chief of these are a physical unconsciousness, an absence
of coquetry, and a liberation of the mind so complete that
a sudden recall has all the effects of shock. Thus, a model
posing for a whole class of men has been known to faint
because she has been seen through the skylight by a
"man" who mended the roof.</p>

<p>In some such state of liberation Louie, on an afternoon
late in the June of 1900, posed for Billy Izzard. It was
in Billy's new studio, a large upper room in Camden
Town, opposite the Cobden Statue. The place was so
light that Billy had actually had to cut some of the light
off. The upper part of the far window, that towards
which Louie's face was turned, was darkened by a linen
blind; the lower part of it was shrouded with tissue paper.
The whole corner was enclosed by a screen. It was there
that Billy did his etching. Behind another screen was
Billy's bed. At present Louie's clothes lay on it.</p>

<p>It was half-past five, but the best light of a changeable
day. They had had tea; the tray with the tea-things lay
on the floor; and, except that he grunted occasionally,
"Raise your hand a bit," or "Head a bit more round,"
Billy's absorption in his work was complete. He had even
worked through the short rests. During these intervals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Louie had crocheted. The crochet, only a little whiter
than the foot near it, lay on the throne now.</p>

<p>Louie was not thinking; you can hardly call it thought
when any trifle on which your eyes rest gives your mind
its cue. Louie's eyes, the only parts of her that moved,
had rested on the crochet, and that had brought Céleste
into her mind. Céleste was leaving her; it had something
to do with phylloxera and a brother's vines; Céleste, between
two loves, must leave the boy and return to Provence.
Then Louie's eyes fell on the chair in which Billy etched,
and presently Kitty occupied her&mdash;Kitty, who liked her
etchings in pairs, but surmised that odd ones came cheaper.
Louie had really no choice but to do what she was going to
do about Kitty. Jimmy must have somebody during the
day, and Louie, moreover, must have ten shillings a week
from somewhere. As a matter of fact, Kitty had agreed
to pay her fifteen shillings, and, in the intervals of looking
after Jimmy, proposed to type. Then, as her eyes
moved to the screen round the bed, she remembered that
her boots must be resoled. They would carry another sole,
and it had been raining off and on during the greater part
of the day. And then something else brought little Jimmy
into her mind again.</p>

<p>For a wonder, she had not thought of a bigger Jimmy
all the afternoon. But on other afternoons she had.
Billy sometimes remarked on a passing tender colour; she
always had to restrain a smile at that. Her tender colour?
There was not a particle of that looked-at superficies of
hers that, often and often, did not answer to a secret
thought.... Perhaps Billy, plain common-sense man,
could have told her what those secret thoughts really
meant. Perhaps Billy, sensitive painter, could have told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
her how sweet and pale and charming things must shun
comparison with the robuster stuff. As, in some delicate
pastoral or <i>fête galante</i>, art might turn its happy eyes
inward on itself, so that the putting on of a slipper and
the nymph's hand trembling in a silken fold and the
promised favour of a smiling look hardly die because they
hardly live, so Louie too turned her eyes inwards. What
she found within herself still sufficed her.</p>

<p>"Better rest a bit," said Billy, looking up as he began
to scrub in a background.</p>

<p>Louie stepped down from the throne, cast a wrap about
her shoulders, and began to crochet again.</p>

<p>Again she hoped she was not doing an unwise thing in
having Kitty to come and live with her. But the flat was
at last taken. It was a top one in the New King's Road.
A Board School now blocks out the pretty view that Louie
presently had at night, of the distant cupful of light that
was Earls Court, with the illuminated advertisement of
the Big Wheel appearing and disappearing as the structure
slowly turned. Well, Kitty's fifteen shillings would pay
the rent, and the experiment would be a good thing for
Kitty also. Louie had furniture enough&mdash;in fact, it
would be a very good thing&mdash;all round.</p>

<p>"Come along&mdash;time," Billy grunted. "And I say, can
you stop a bit later to-night? I've got to go out, but if I
don't finish this thing to-day I never shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie mounted the throne again, and again the silence
was broken only by Billy's stepping back from his canvas
and forward again.</p>

<p>The light began to fail, and Billy began to work the
more furiously. "Give me just another ten minutes," he
muttered, a brush between his teeth; "this'll make some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of 'em sit up, I think; it's <i>painting</i>, this is!... But I
don't know, perhaps I'd better let it go as it is; it's a job,
anyway. All right, Louie, thanks.... Right-o, Jeffries;
I didn't think it was so late."</p>

<p>The last words were spoken to the man who had knocked
at the door and, without waiting for a reply, walked in.</p>

<p>Louie had heard the steps on the stairs; perhaps&mdash;she
could not tell&mdash;she had already thought it unusual that the
steps had not stopped at the water-tap on the landing
below that was the supply for the two upper floors. Billy
used that tap when he washed his brushes; he was looking
for his palette-knife now.</p>

<p>But Louie neither saw Billy nor heard his grumblings
because the knife was not to hand. She was looking past
Billy, past the easel with the study upon it, at the man
who had entered. For one moment she was wondering
that she had not always known, not only that he would
come some day, but that he would come that day; the next
moment she had told herself that she had always known
that.</p>

<p>Of her whole body, from the foot near the crochet to the
last brown hair of her head, her lips were the only portion
that did not receive him with a lightsome, quiet, fair,
trusting smile.</p>

<p>Absurd ever to have supposed that they would never
meet! Wise to have known so perfectly what would happen
when they did!</p>

<p>What had happened? Oh, every particle of her seemed
to sing to every other particle what had happened! Those
pittings of her profession? Oh, there they went, washed
out, all out, in the baptism of a look! Her fancies&mdash;those
idle promises to pay drawn on a non-existent bank? Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
they had gone, and here was payment itself, the solid,
actual cash! She was suddenly rich. As she stood there,
rich in seeing him, rich in being seen by him, every one
of those worthless bills was honoured in full. She could
have laughed at her past poverty. She could have cried
aloud: "Jim, I'm here&mdash;look at me&mdash;no, not my eyes
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he too seemed to be as she had always known he
would be&mdash;singled out, down to his very manner of wearing
his clothes&mdash;among men. Stupid, that of all those
times she had thought of him she had never once thought
of him as in evening-dress! But that, in all this perfection,
was only one more reciprocated perfection: she so&mdash;he
so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim&mdash;<i>not</i> my eyes only!" she well-nigh cried
again.</p>

<p>But the lion's eyes never moved from her own grey
ones.</p>

<p>"Right, Louie, I've finished," said Billy, looking up
from his palette-scraping.</p>

<p>And within herself she wailed: "Oh, <i>so</i> soon? Must
it be over already? Must I sit for men all these days, and
then, when <i>my</i> man comes&mdash;&mdash;? Oh, a moment!...
Well, he shall see me move&mdash;and I won't look at him&mdash;I'll
tell myself&mdash;oh, just one more fancy!&mdash;that he isn't
here."</p>

<p>She descended from the throne and passed behind the
screen.</p>

<p>Was it strange that already, as she dressed in Billy's
studio, she knew that she would never dress in an artist's
studio again, and made of her fastening of hooks and
strings a grave little ceremonial?&mdash;(There! With that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
fastening yet another chapter was closed; oh, trust her,
there should be no reopening of it!)&mdash;Or that she should
have a little shiver, at the thought that he might not have
come? Suppose he had knocked at the door, and Billy
had cried: "Half-a-moment&mdash;slide, Louie&mdash;come in!"
Suppose&mdash;but the tremor passed. She had always known
he would come; she had known it just as she had known
everything else about him. Again every fibre of her was
joyous. She was here on the earth&mdash;she, Louie Causton,
daughter of a pugilist and of a Scarisbrick, gardener,
typist, artists' model, and all else she might ever be&mdash;that
she might know all about this man. To have ever doubted
it would have been not to deserve him. And here he was,
in the same room with her&mdash;he, beyond the screen, she
behind it&mdash;only the two of them, for Billy had gone down
to the tap to wash his brushes.</p>

<p><i>Now</i> what should she do?</p>

<p>No, she would not go out and join him; not as she now
was; not a skirt and blouse, after that fairness. Nor yet
would she speak. Surely it was for him to speak now!
She had been speaking to him, singing to him, all music to
his eyes; there does come a point (she told herself) when
the woman ceases to do everything; he must speak now.
She knew he would speak. So she stood, upright, close to
the screen, waiting.</p>

<p>He did speak, and like smoke another flock of fancies
fled for ever. They were the fancies in which she had
tried to remember his voice. It came, henceforth unforgettable,
pure rest after her strivings. He too seemed
to be near the screen; only a screen between them; but
the phrases that were breaking their long silence were
merely automatic. He was saying something about seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
her presently; she heard him pronounce the word
"Piccadilly," and the most familiar image of Piccadilly
sprang up in her mind. "Swan and Edgar's," she was
whispering back over the screen.</p>

<p>"No, no." This came quickly, protestingly.</p>

<p>"At half-past ten," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then the dialogue was at an end. Billy had returned.
Some moments later she heard more words, a laugh, and
the closing of a door. She realised that he had gone.</p>

<p>Only then did she come out from behind the screen.</p>

<p>Billy was wriggling into his overcoat and muttering
something about being late. "Got to go and keep that
chap's wife company," he said. "Regular little Philistine,
she is; I suppose that's why I go; can't stand these
blessed artists. I say, he'd no idea I'd a model, you know&mdash;sorry."</p>

<p>"All right, Billy," said Louie demurely.... "Sorry!"
So was not she!</p>

<p>"And I say, I'm afraid I shall have to pay you next
time. I'm cleaned out."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. Send me a steak in as you go out;
I'll have my dinner here."</p>

<p>"Right. Odd-looking chap that, isn't he? A good
sort though. I picked him up at the Langham one night.
I took this place from him when he got married."</p>

<p>"He lived here?" (What, another wonder?)</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, I'll send your steak in. Good-bye."
Billy bolted.</p>

<p>He had lived there too! How ex&mdash;how entirely to
have been expected! Louie walked round the room, looking
at the walls, the ceiling, out of the windows, anew.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
He had lived there: read, eaten, slept there; what a
coinci&mdash;what a perfectly natural circumstance! Then,
leaning against the wall, she found Billy's study. Her
eyes devoured it. She set it against the throne, and then
walked to where he had stood when he had entered. She
gave a rich, low laugh; she told herself what a fool she
was; but folly so lovely made life. Again she looked at
the wet painting. She had looked so to him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She put the study back against the wall, but in another
place. "That study's mine, Billy," she muttered; "mine,
not yours or anybody else's, do you understand? You
gave him my violets; he's welcome to them; this belongs
to me. Jim! Jim!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it's crochet now," she went on by-and-by.
"Do you realise, Louie Causton, that you've sat
your last? And have you any idea of what you're going
to do instead? It looks as though Kitty's fifteen shillings
would come in useful after all."</p>

<p>As if otherwise she might have forgotten it, she repeated
to herself, over and over again, that she was to meet him
at Swan and Edgar's at half-past ten. At one of the
repetitions&mdash;it was as she was cooking her steak over the
little gas-ring that, perhaps, had once been his&mdash;it occurred
to her why he had muttered that quick "No, no," when
she had proposed that meeting-place. She glowed, she
laughed through a sheen of tender tears. "Dear, dear
one! <i>You</i> don't think that corner good enough for us,
my sweet little outcast and me. Well, we won't thank
you; we won't belittle him by thanking him, will we,
Jimmy?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she did not promise not to look her thanks when she
met him at Swan and Edgar's at half-past ten.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>Presently she pushed her plate away; she could not eat.
She had felt her bosom rise once more. It had risen as it
had never risen for anything or anybody save for the little
Jimmy, and it rose, it seemed to her, for a similar reason.
For in her hands even his physical safety lay. He was to
be mothered too. Her unfelt arms were to be about him,
the milk of her protection to be his life. By his strength
he had thought to give himself to somebody else, but by
his need he was still hers. A gladness richer than she
had ever, ever known swelled within her. He, the
great weakling&mdash;she, the strong one, to cherish and support&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jim!" she murmured, smiling, uplifted, lost. It
was as if his weary, tawny head was on her breast.</p>

<p>And she was going to hear his voice again, at Swan and
Edgar's, at half-past ten.</p>

<p>She feared that her own emotion might have exhausted
her ere ever the hour came.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">II</p>

<p>"Your hat will be spoiled if you don't take your
share of the umbrella," she said. It was a silk
hat, and she supposed that silk hats cost money. A fine,
persistent rain was falling.</p>

<p>She thought that he answered that it didn't matter.</p>

<p>"Then you might at least turn your trousers up."
Her own shabby old grey coat didn't matter, but his trousers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He seemed to be on the point of replying that they
didn't matter either, but changed his mind. He stooped
and turned them up. She held the umbrella while he did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
so, and then gave it to him again, replacing her right hand
where it had been&mdash;on his left forearm.</p>

<p>It was on these mere externals of him&mdash;his hat, his
coat, his trousers, his boots&mdash;that she had hardly for a
moment ceased to feed her eyes. Anything else might
wait; for the present the stuff of his sleeve was more to
her than the stuff of his soul. She luxuriated shamelessly
in the smallest actualities of his presence; why, even mirth
stood but a remove away. His overcoat, for example: it
was not that old tawny one that had made him so much
like a lion, but it was an old one for all that; was she
<i>never</i> to see her man in a new overcoat? Jim and his
overcoats! But the rest of him was beyond criticism.
Certainly he must be making money. She wished she
could have called money to him with a wand, conjured it to
him, as much as ever he wanted. Had it not been that she
would have had to take her hand from his sleeve, she
would have liked to step back to look at his great church-door
of a back again. Of his face she could see little,
but that did not prevent her looking until it would hardly
have surprised her had he flushed and said, "Don't gloat
over me like that." His hat was tilted down, the large
peaks of his overcoat collar projected like wings.</p>

<p>No, she did not want to know what he thought or felt;
bother all that part of him! When her thirsty senses had
drunk their full, then would be time enough for the other
things.</p>

<p>They were walking somewhere behind the Horse
Guards. Stretching before them was the long, empty
avenue of the Mall. She was looking at the perspective
of lamps and trees and drizzle, when suddenly he spoke.
Instantly all her faculties seemed to become one overgrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
faculty, that of hearing. Not that he was saying
anything; he was, as a matter of fact, only asking her
whether she was warm; and she replied, "Quite." She
was almost amused that he should ask. His nearness
warmed her more than did her garments. Her hand
thrilled deliciously on his sleeve again....</p>

<p>Oh, the satisfaction of that, just that, after all her past
inquisitions into his soul!</p>

<p>But come to speech they must, and that very soon; and
perhaps that curious magnification of trifles made it
easier. Indeed, half the formidableness of the single
question she wanted to ask him had vanished already.
To say to him, now or in a few moments: "Did you kill
Archie Merridew?" seemed somehow not very much more
unusual than asking him the time. Now that she came
to think of it, even that question seemed less important
than another one: "Can you kill somebody and still be
happy?" She hoped in her heart that he could. It
would be his justification. Had it been an unrighteous
killing, that would have been another matter; as it was,
she would have had him unhappy only had he not killed.
And, as he showed no sign of breaking silence, she might
as well ask him that now.</p>

<p>So, reluctantly turning her eyes from his face and looking
ahead into the haze of the rain, she suddenly said:
"Are you happy?"</p>

<p>She wasn't surprised that he didn't reply at once. Of
course men didn't. They had their usual formalities to
go through, of "Why do you ask?" and so forth&mdash;a sort
of routine before they could answer a plain question. As
he began to go through it now she made a little impatient
movement. She didn't want all that. Then he deigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
to reply to her inferior intelligence. Yes, he was happy.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i>?" she said, with an exultant little leap.</p>

<p>Yes, he was; but again, apparently, he couldn't say a
thing and leave it. In the middle of more stupid, logical,
masculine things (he seemed to be qualifying his statement
with something or other about his conduct to Kitty
Windus) she cut him short.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, repeating the little impatient gesture,
"you killed that boy, didn't you?"</p>

<p>They had been following the railings that divided the
Mall from St. James's Park, but she had stopped to ask
her question. And she was looking full at him now.
But she could not see him very well; a lamp and a plane-tree
made all an obscurity of vague shadows and wet reflections.
But then he stepped slowly back, taking her
umbrella with him, and twice, as he held the umbrella unsteadily,
the light came and went on his cheek and chin;
and then, as he took a step farther back still, the umbrella
bobbed on the railings, from the points of it came little
bright slivers of drops, and she found herself searching
under a lamplit sector of alpaca for his eyes.</p>

<p>The danger of asking, actually, a question you have
asked, but not actually, a hundred times before, is that
your own mere familiarity with it throws you out in your
calculation. Now she found herself suddenly hoping that
what she felt to be working beyond the umbrella edge&mdash;for
she felt it rather than saw it&mdash;was not fear.</p>

<p>For, of course, she had miscalculated a little&mdash;had been
stupid to think that it was all as old a story to him as it
was to her. Obviously it would not at once occur to him
that there had been nothing to find out, but that instead
the whole thing had been merely enacted before her eyes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
he was sure to be thinking that on some point of evidence
he had been betrayed. What sort of point that could be,
unless it had something to do with the black eyes that
seemed to haunt Kitty, he might know, but she could not
guess; and all at once she had a purely physical shrinking.
She would rather not know. She could string herself up
to the thought of murder, but the bestial details&mdash;no, not
those. Those were his affairs. They were to be taken for
granted as things necessarily involved. And already she
was on the point of feeling herself a little disappointed in
him. For in the shadow of the umbrella her eyes had now
found his; his head was a little turned, and she saw the
whites of them.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> fear. She, it seemed, could contemplate unafraid
a sacrifice that he quaked to have carried out.</p>

<p>But as, with another little falling of drops from the
umbrella, he steadied himself and stepped forward from
the railings again, additional light came to her. It was
fear, but not that fear, that haunted the amber eyes. The
fear was of herself. He feared, not the information she
possessed, but her whole understanding and condemnation.
He feared lest she also should say: "It was murder;
you are here to be judged; me too, with all the world,
you must account against you; I set my mark too upon
your brow."</p>

<p>And as he appeared sorrowfully to acquiesce in that
also, nothing could have seemed lonelier nor more touching
than the quietly spoken words with which he held the
umbrella over her again:</p>

<p>"You're getting wet."</p>

<p>It was as though he told her that though he went outcast
she must not get wet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>Her answer was to put her hand under his sleeve again.
They walked on.</p>

<p>But he had not answered her question. Perhaps he
thought he had: to all intents and purposes he had; but
she wanted, not so much the word, as that he should not
withhold the word. He was walking slowly, heavily, like
a tower by her side; she had the sense of his fearful overweight;
she would give him time. They continued to
walk, their mingled shadow on the pavement as they passed
each lamp creeping away before them as if the beam of
some lighthouse had had the sinister property of obscurity.</p>

<p>Then, within a little distance of Buckingham Palace,
she stopped again. Again their eyes met under the wet,
black mushroom of the umbrella.</p>

<p>"You did kill that boy, didn't you?"</p>

<p>He had a slight start. It seemed to her that he even
apologised for having kept her waiting for the answer.
Formerly she had seen stratagems in his eyes; now, as
he dipped the umbrella for a moment and stood full in the
light of another lamp, she looked only into grave, candid
depths.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "You know I killed him."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>Again her hand slid, as if of itself, back into its place.
Again they walked on. The next thing that came to her
was another ridiculous yet oddly precious trifle. She
wore kid gloves; before, when she had danced with him in
an old frock of oyster-grey, she had worn white ones;
must she (she wondered) always wear gloves with him, as
he always wore old overcoats? She longed to take one
glove off; yet she&mdash;she, who had met Roy by the stile at
night&mdash;for very bashfulness dared not. The circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
struck her; how was that? Gifts of understanding for
her he had: had he that gift too, the gift of her own bashfulness
back again? Up went her spirit on wings....</p>

<p>Yes, it was that&mdash;or for a night at least she would have
it so. As impossibilities are reconciled in a dream, so he
seemed, by his mere towerlike presence, to resolve in one
large atonement, her own life as it had been and the sweet
and virginal and dear smiling thing that it might have
been. In no less a miracle than that she seemed to herself
to be walking. He could not only have kissed her; he
could have had her first kiss. He could not only have
turned, as he did turn, leaning against the pillar-box by the
Equerries' entrance of the Palace, to look at her again, but
he could have received in return&mdash;did receive in return&mdash;such
a look as she knew he also could hardly have had the
like of before. And it made no difference&mdash;as in a dream
such a thing might make no difference&mdash;that he had a
wife, she a son. Let him have his wife, she her son; she
could find room for wives and sons too. To-morrow,
perhaps, it would not be so; to-morrow might be like
yesterday again; but to-night&mdash;to-night&mdash;oh, the first
garden was not less trodden than these rainy streets, the
Barracks, Gorringes', and Grosvenor Road! Her hand
moving again on his sleeve was telling him even now, if he
would but listen, that though man may not know that it is
not good for him to be alone, woman knows it, and maybe
still remembers it out of her knowledge of the place whence
she came later than he.</p>

<p>And he too understood now, for she was not so rapt but
that she remembered that he asked her, somewhere between
a sandbin and a street lamp, whether she was happy
too, and that, looking up at him, she smilingly whispered:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
"Yes, now." And she was not so rapt but that she remembered
telling him, flatly and with another happy and
laughing and triumphant look: "You can't prevent it!"
But she was so rapt that of much else that he and she said
she had no very clear recollection. Words that seemed
unforgettable when they came had eluded her almost in
their own echo. But she knew that she gave him the
liberty of herself with no more reserve than she had
claimed that of him. She knew that because, later, but
she did not know when, he muttered, in some street
or other, she did not know where: "God bless your
boy."</p>

<p>Well, if she forgot things now, there would be many
days to come in which she would remember them.</p>

<p>Merely because it must be very late&mdash;she had no idea
what time it was&mdash;she grudged the going of the moments
almost angrily. Already she was becoming as hungry
again as if she had not broken that long, long fast. But
she admitted that it was not unnatural that he should
think of his own concerns a little too, and want to ask her
questions. She began to answer the questions hurriedly,
to get them over.&mdash;Kitty Windus? Oh (she told him) he
might leave Kitty to her; she'd answer for Kitty!&mdash;His
wife and her complete ignorance? (His wife's ignorance
appeared to be complete.)&mdash;Miriam Levey? (Oh, why
would he not be quick, and she so hungry!)&mdash;And then
back to his wife again; what about her? (he wanted to
know). Louie wondered a little that he should consider
her to be his wife's keeper also, but she answered his
questions. That, she told him, was his private affair;
but, if he really wanted to know what Louie thought
about it, Louie could not conceive of a marriage with so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
huge a secret in it continuing undisclosed. <i>Voilà</i>; there
he had it; and <i>now</i> might she please be permitted to enter
into her own happiness again?</p>

<p>She was back into it, bathing in it again, almost before
she was aware. A minute before she had not known what
street they were in; now she saw the Chelsea Hospital on
the other side of the road. On this side was a row of
houses; she knew one of them; a painter for whom she
had sat lived there; his studio was in the yard at the back.
The thought of a studio was all that was needed. She
thrilled again.</p>

<p>No more studios! So poignantly did she burn that she
could hardly imagine that her glowing did not communicate
itself. Studios, after that beautiful, beautiful sketch
of Billy's? Good gracious, no! She was going to Billy's
to fetch that sketch on the morrow; she would like to see
Billy deny it to her! And that poor, poor old oyster-grey!
Just because he had seen her in it once she had
mooned over it, smiled over it, sighed over it; but it could
go now&mdash;she had a richer memory!... Furtively during
the last few minutes she had been working off her
right glove; it slipped from her hand to the pavement; but
she was afraid to stop. Let it stay; somebody would turn
it over with the point of a walking-stick in the morning
and perhaps wonder who had lost it.... She stole another
look at him; her hand crept along his sleeve; the tips
of her fingers were on his wrist; her lips shaped his name:
"Jim!"</p>

<p>Then, unexpectedly, it rushed upon her in full measure.
She knew these streets familiarly; they were in Swan
Walk now; and the thing happened all in a moment.
Again, during those anxious questions of his about Kitty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Windus, Miriam Levey, his wife, she had that sense of
his terrible overweight: now, passing a doorway, he suddenly
reeled. He began to sink....</p>

<p>In an instant her arms were about him. Not the unfelt,
immaterial arms of her mothering vision in Billy's studio,
not that other breast, offered but impressed, sustained
him; she held him within her two arms of flesh and blood,
upon that firm, warm bosom that changed its shape to his
weight upon it&mdash;the bosom he had seen yesterday, white
hives, all their honey his.... She bent and kissed the
shoulder of his coat. Oh, if he might but faint, quite,
that she might carry him somewhere, or, if she could not
carry him, stay with him where he was&mdash;she cared not&mdash;rest
by his side through an endless night! Her heart, yes,
her lips too, called him; a whisper might not reach him;
she called him aloud:</p>

<p>"Oh, come, come! Come, come!"</p>

<p class="p2">Afterwards she thought of it as a hail from a ship to
another ship across a stretch of water so narrow that it
was all but a stepping aboard. How could such a hail be
a farewell also? They were not passing; as they glided
side by side together, either seemed stationary. Other
things, the whole offing of Life, were in motion; these
slipped past, as it were sky, shore, shipping; but for a
space he and she spoke from bridge to bridge. And he
heard the hail too, for he opened his eyes. Though
they never looked on her again they did so now, relinquishing
all to her. Was there anything she had not known?
There was nothing she might not know&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>By-and-by she had helped him to a seat on the Embankment
and had made him sit down. She took off his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
tie and collar; she smiled as he thanked her. "That was
absurd," he said.</p>

<p>Then he asked her where she lived.</p>

<p>It was over.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps more would have been more than she
could have borne.</p>

<p>But when she sat at last alone in the hansom he had
called, conscious that she was wet to the skin and that her
boots needed to be resoled, she still had the image of the
ships before her eyes, gliding together side by side, with
all else in quiet, relentless motion behind them. She held
fast to it. She could not have endured to think that of
that night's long wandering all that would remain on the
morrow would be yet another dream and a wet glove left
behind in an empty Chelsea street.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">III</p>

<p>Louie Causton would have been more than human
had she not frequently thought, as her life became
a moving from pillar to post again, that there was
an exasperating proportion of absence in her heart's story.
But at first she was not petulant. Some absences are
brimful, as other presences are mere vacancy, and, now
that she no longer sat, she had other things, plenty of
them, to think of.</p>

<p>There was little money in the sale of crochet; there was
not much more in sitting in costumes hired from the
Models' Club. From both these things she quickly turned.
Perhaps she turned from them the more quickly because
of Kitty Windus&mdash;for Kitty was now with her in the flat
in the New Kings Road, and the way in which Kitty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
without spoken words, paid over her weekly fifteen shillings,
was in itself a spur. Not that Kitty always spared her the
words either. Two words at least that she did not always
spare her were "rise" and "permanency." Often Louie
felt all the amazement, and now quite without any leaven
of amusement, that she had felt when first she had entered
the Business School in Holborn; but she was not keeping
Kitty (or Kitty keeping her) either for love of Kitty or
her own mere necessity. To keep Kitty was part and
parcel of that absence she was already beginning to resent.
It was merely safer to keep Kitty than to have anybody
else keep her. Besides, as long as she kept Kitty, she had
only to write a note, justifying it afterwards as best she
could, and two ships (so to speak) would come together
again. She delayed to write the note; none the less it was
in her power to do so.</p>

<p>So (to turn for a moment to that moving background of
Life in the offing) the September of 1900 found her answering
the advertisement of a Bayswater seedsman and
discovering the precise market value of her old Rainham
Parva training. But by the end of the same month she
was temporarily installed at the clerk's table of an exhibition
of French paintings at a Mayfair gallery, and glad of
the job. Say (the question is hardly worth going into)
that it was the influence of the paintings themselves that
once more caused a manager to propose that Louie's wages
should be substantially increased, for a consideration; it
didn't matter; Louie, who did not now throw away jobs
for nothing, merely told the man not to be silly&mdash;than
which, as it happened, she could have done no better thing,
for at the close of the exhibition the manager, now looking
upon her almost as a dear daughter, found her another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
place, this time at a gallery academic both artistically and
morally, warned her against dangerous young men, and
kissed Louie on both her laughing cheeks. After that her
French again served her turn, for she entered the office
of an illustrated weekly; or if it was not entirely the
French that did it, so much the luckier Louie to possess
even yet a frock that was a rest to the proprietor's eyes
after a succession of applicants in walking skirts and
white muslin blouses. This job Louie actually kept till
June 1901; then an amalgamation took place that threw
her out of work again. Three weeks later, after a severe
trial of her temper by Kitty, she was a "carpet designer"&mdash;that
is to say, she coloured, in an upper room near St.
Paul's Churchyard, pieces of paper so minutely chequered
that sometimes for an hour or two she could not get the
flicker out of her eyes. She made a grace of retiring
from this occupation as soon as she saw that if she did not
do so her employer would retire from the office of paymaster.
After that she was reduced to sitting again, in
costume. Nothing else offered. Jimmy must eat,
Kitty's fifteen shillings be covered. The female figure in
"The Two-stringed Bow," which caused such a (journalistic)
sensation in the Academy of the following year, is
Louie. Chaff did not recognise it. Billy Izzard, who
had seen the costume at the Models' Club, did. He persecuted
Louie to sit for him again as before.</p>

<p>Of the Models' Club she was still a member, and she got
on well with the girls. Once she took Kitty Windus
there, but only once; a black-and-white man, knowing
nothing of Kitty's pound a week, asked her to sit to him
as Miss Tox, in "Dombey and Son"; and Kitty, presently
reading the book, treated Louie for some days with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
marked superciliousness. That came of making yourself
cheap, her manner seemed to say; and she reported Miriam
Levey, whom she met near Piccadilly Circus one day, as
having said, "Vell, vat do you expect?" Louie did not
much like this meeting with Miriam Levey. She remembered
the Jewess's pertinacity and curiosity for curiosity's
sake. Many such meetings between Kitty and
Miriam Levey might easily complicate her own life.</p>

<p>There were two bedrooms in the flat in the New Kings
Road. In the larger one, that at the back that Louie
shared with Jimmy, there hung at first the sketch she had
begged ("stolen" was Billy's word) after she had ceased
to sit. When Louie took this down one day and put it
out of sight, she told herself that she did so on Jimmy's
account; but perhaps those absences that she had to convert
into presences as best she could had something to do
with it too. Perhaps, if she did not see the thing for
a time, its first freshness would return.</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought these absences really too bad;
she began to think so with increasing frequency as Kitty's
fits of patronage became no rarer. Really it didn't seem
fair that she should be asked to bear them. The least Jim
could have done, since she bore them for him, would have
been to let her know that he still existed. She did not
much mind looking after Kitty, but it was a little too
much that on his part <i>all</i> should be absence!</p>

<p>And that was why, with Kitty always at hand for her
excuse, she did not write to him.</p>

<p>In a word, the joy of bearing for him was becoming
fainter in proportion as the burden itself increased.</p>

<p>Then a piece of news with which Kitty came home one
night added its trifle to her smart. She was alone in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
flat that night; Jimmy had been in bed two hours and
more, and Louie, after having folded his clothes, cleared
up his litter of toys from the floor, and tried to read a
newspaper, had turned low the gas, drawn up a chair to
one of the three windows that looked down on the New
Kings Road, and sat gazing out over the trees and houses
and scattered lights that stretched away to Earls Court.
It happened that that night the Exhibition was closing for
the season; a firework demonstration was in progress; and
out of the little pool of orange light rockets rose from time
to time, falling again in slow showers of red and green and
white. If no cart was passing she could just hear the
muffled detonations.</p>

<p>She knew that if an impossibility could have happened,
and Jim could have walked into the room, sat down by
her, and watched the white and green and red rockets with
her, that slight constant smart at her heart would have
gone; but now she told herself that it was not as if she was
young, with unlimited time before her. She was thirty-two,
and too much absence is not sustenance enough for
thirty-two. But that, she supposed, meant nothing to a
man. Men did not appear to get old in quite the same
way. The man who had tried to make love to her at the
French picture exhibition was sixty if he was a day;
sixty, and still fiery; and apparently he had found her
still desirable also. But it was not for much longer.
Women died with their beauty. Of course she had her
little darling asleep there; men had the comfortable theory
that women wanted nothing more than to "live again"
(as they called it) in their children; well, all that Louie
could say was that she did not agree with them. She
knew one woman who wanted more. It might be wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and unnatural to endow Jimmy, as she had done, with a
sort of vicarious father, but Roy was gone out of her life&mdash;gone;
to have married him would have made more mischief
than it would have cured; and Louie saw no reason
for not telling herself the truth about herself. But a vicarious
father who stayed away was altogether too vicarious....</p>

<p>Well, well, she supposed that if a woman would have a
man at all she must put up with a selfish one.</p>

<p>He, of course, knew exactly what he wanted, and had
got it; nor could she say that he had not earned it&mdash;grimly.
But now that he had got it, what about somebody
else who was helping him to keep it&mdash;somebody
called Louie Causton, who stepped in when she was wanted,
took half the burden off his back, and was presently sent
about her business again? (For she had remembered
now the quite personal, preoccupied questions, about
Kitty and Miriam and his wife, that he had put to her
on the night of their long walk.) Oh, no doubt she would
be there when she was next wanted, to share with him the
thing another woman ought to have shared (but thank
goodness the other woman had not!). It had not in the
least surprised Louie that his wife knew nothing. It
would have surprised her very much indeed if she had
known anything. Jim might humbug himself as he liked,
but at the bottom of his heart (she now saw) he knew
better than to tell her. She was not the kind; it was
Louie who was that kind, and he knew it too. But there:
she was pretty, and men asked no further; give them hair
and eyes and an unlined brow and the rest could go
hang. Heart and vision&mdash;no; courage and devotion and
the strength to bear&mdash;no; but twenty years, a curving eyelash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and a bloom more quickly gone than the falling rockets
yonder, and ah, how they ran! But they didn't trust
them. No, the other sort was sent for then. And it was
the business of the other sort to be, always, as strong as
they sometimes thought themselves.</p>

<p>The last rocket fell; the lights of the big wheel began to
make quicker revolutions; and Louie left the window and
turned up the gas again.</p>

<p>As she did so the electric bell in the kitchen rang. It
rang again, and then Louie remembered that the street
door four floors below would be closed for the night. She
passed out on to the landing and descended the stairs.
It was Kitty. She had forgotten her key. Kitty panted
as they ascended again.</p>

<p>"How long have you been in?" she demanded, as she
took off her hat and coat in the little hall.</p>

<p>"All the evening," said Louie. "Have you had supper?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Kitty shortly, and then came her
grumble. Why hadn't Louie had the gas lighted? Fireworks
indeed! And there Kitty had been waiting for
twenty minutes and more, thinking nobody was in&mdash;anybody
might forget their key once in a while, mightn't
they? Hadn't Louie forgotten hers not a week ago, and
that not the only time? Kitty had a right to forget her
key sometimes. And there had Louie been in all the
time, watching fireworks! Well, what was there for supper?
And the fire almost out too; really, if Kitty paid
for the coals, Louie might at least keep the fire in!</p>

<p>Louie mended the fire and got Kitty's supper. When
Kitty had finished she cleared the little round table again,
and by the time Kitty had put on a pair of red bedroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
slippers and turned up her skirt to the blaze she deigned
to relent a little. She admitted that it wasn't as if Louie
had known she was waiting in the street, but all the
same it was annoying.</p>

<p>"And now I've got a piece of news for you," she said,
warming her hands. "It's a dead secret, but I don't suppose
Miriam would mind my telling you. She's in for no
end of a good job in a few weeks! But she always gets
good jobs. She has determination, Miriam has, you
see."</p>

<p>Louie was standing by the end of the mantelpiece, stirring
a cup of cocoa. She only said "Oh?" Her own
lack of determination was now an old reproach.</p>

<p>"Ra-<i>ther</i>! Have you heard me speak of a Mr. Pepper
ever? But no, you won't have; you're always a bit sniffy
about Miriam, you see, and that doesn't encourage people
to talk. Well, she's his confidential clerk at the Freight
and Ballast Company, but he's chucking that, and who do
you think with?&mdash;James Jeffries!"</p>

<p>She paused to see the effect on Louie, and then continued.</p>

<p>"Yes, James Jeffries! What do you think of <i>that</i>?
They're going to start on their own, in no end of a swell
way, and Miriam's going over with them. It's Mr. Pepper's
doing, of course, and as Mr. Pepper isn't exactly a
nobody even where he is, you may bet your boots he won't
change for the worse! Oh, James Jeffries knows the kind
of person to hang on to! He's to be a partner, if you
please, as good as Mr. Pepper himself; how's that for
greasing in? Friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,
I <i>don't</i> think!"</p>

<p>Kitty had this way now of speaking of her former <i>fiancé</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Sometimes she so extended his name that it became "Mister
James Herbert Jeffries." And however Jim now
"got on," his advancement would still be, to Kitty, a
magnification of her own superiority in those days when
she had had a pound a week and he nothing. She began
to take out hairpins and went on.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I wish my brushes were here!" (Louie
fetched them.) "What was I saying? Oh yes, about
Miriam. She's to have an office to herself, perhaps, or at
any rate she's not going to sit with the other girls; and
when I tell you it's in Pall Mall, you can judge for yourself&mdash;not
just a couple of offices rented, but a whole building&mdash;what
ho! The stone that the builders rejected if you
like! And she'll have her own extending-bracket telephone,
the very latest, and arms to her chair to put her
elbows on, not like the typists! And Mr. Pepper's most
friendly with her&mdash;she takes down his conversations with
no end of swells! And I say, Evie Jeffries won't be half
set up over it all, oh no! Even <i>his</i> office&mdash;James Herbert's,
Miriam says&mdash;is going to be perfectly scrumptious!"</p>

<p>Her head was on one side; her short hair, as she brushed
it, hardly reached farther than the sharp point of her
shoulder; and Louie was thinking of that spurious engagement
again. And suddenly&mdash;this had happened before,
but never before with so keen a stab&mdash;the thought set her
raging.... She herself had been so near!... Her elbow
caught her cup of cocoa; it spilt, and ran in a little
stream from the corner of the mantelpiece.... So near!
And once again she cried to herself that <i>she</i> would have
known how to keep him, Roy or no Roy!... Kitty?
What could his courtship of Kitty and her bones have been?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
<i>She</i> would have shown him the difference! To have
been so near and then&mdash;Mortlake Road, Putney!</p>

<p>Suddenly there seemed to her to be a great deal to be
said for conventional morality after all.</p>

<p>For a moment her heart was full of hate&mdash;hate of Kitty,
hate of Evie Jeffries, hate of Roy, hate of herself. To
have been so near!</p>

<p>But the sharpness of it died down to a sullen ache. In
his affairs he seemed to be going up, up; she had always
known he would; and less than ever might she expect to
hear from him now. And he would take his common little
wife up with him. He might go anywhere, meet anybody;
but sourly she wondered what sort of a figure he
supposed his Evie would cut up there&mdash;would have cut at
Trant or Mallard Bois? Oh, Louie would dearly have
liked to see her there, to have pointed to her, and to have
told Jim to his face that whatever ability he might have
seemed to be yoked with an unimaginable stupidity, since
he had not known instantly the one woman for him.</p>

<p>Well, there was simply no accounting for these things.</p>

<p>But if he was going up, Louie did not very much like
the channel by which she had received the information.
She had known that Kitty saw Miriam Levey; now she
seemed to hear her thick voice again, "I <i>vill</i> find out!"
She was aware, too, that there was little love lost between
Miriam Levey and herself. She herself had encouraged
Kitty in her present attitude of "Mister Jeffries," but
it only needed the Jewess to propose the contrary attitude
and in all probability there would be a struggle between
them for the possession of Kitty. She detested Kitty;
yet in order that Evie Jeffries might make an exhibition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
herself among the people whose equal Louie was, Louie
had to put up with her, bones and chilblains and all!
Much he left her, didn't he? Good gracious, yes! And
it was about time he was told that flesh and blood women
weren't made like that!</p>

<p>Kitty, remarking that it was a shame to leave the now
glowing fire, had passed out of the room for a minute; she
now returned, in her slippers and nightgown. Her feet,
she said, were still cold with waiting on the pavement;
she would say her prayers with them turned to the fire.
She knelt by a wicker chair, and set the red slippers on the
low kerb, their worn soles to the fire. Louie, still from the
end of the mantelpiece, watched her. At a slight sound
she made Kitty turned her head for a moment; then she
put it on the cushion of the chair again.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly Louie must have a wicked heart, or she
would not have looked on the kneeling woman as she did.
She wondered what, texts apart, Kitty could have to say
to God. To pray&mdash;with her feet in a warm place! Why,
Louie mortified herself more for an absent man than Kitty
seemed to do before her Maker!... And even when she
had stifled the thought she still had no more than a negative
compassion for Kitty. She was not unsorry for her
and her weakheadedness; beyond that Kitty was not, or
ought not to have been, her affair. What was her affair
was herself and what little remained of her youth. Kitty
was hardly more than a year or two older than she, but she
looked a dozen years older; Louie wondered whether her
shoulder blades too would soon resemble the set-squares in
Billy's studio, whether her waist also would seem a broken
thing within empty looking folds....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty continued to pray and to warm her feet. Louie,
wondering what her next snappishness would be when she
rose from her knees again, continued to watch her.</p>

<p>Then Kitty rose. She turned to Louie.</p>

<p>"By the way, did you brush that blue skirt of mine?"
she said. "Oh, very well, it doesn't matter now; perhaps
I oughtn't to have asked you; thank you; I can do
it myself in the morning. Sorry I spoke."</p>

<p>Louie turned away.</p>

<p>These were the times when she could hardly tell what
had possessed her ever to have supposed that she would be
able to keep watch and ward over Kitty at all. Kitty was
perfectly free to meet Miriam Levey or anybody else she
had a mind to meet. And why, she asked herself at these
times, should she not meet her? Where, hanging and
such moonshine apart, was the risk to Jim? Indeed, it
seemed to Louie that that story that seemed so to weigh on
Jim was quickly becoming altogether beside the mark.
The whole venue of his difficulties was rapidly shifting.
What he had done had not been discovered and probably
never would be discovered; what he wanted now was, not
to be protected from remote and shadowy and nonsensical
dangers, but to be told how he was to be happy with the
wife whom he had seen fit, in the great heap of his wisdom,
to keep in ignorance. Of course the remoter danger need
not be entirely forgotten, but this, or else Louie was
greatly mistaken, was what those scarce-heard questions
on the night of that long walk had really meant.</p>

<p>And, in that case, what the devil was she, Louie Causton,
doing in this gallery at all, with nothing of Jim but
silence and absence, and nothing but peevishness and
petty tyranny from Kitty? Roy, it might be, was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
ready to marry her; Buck never ceased to importune, sulk
and implore; Jimmy, one way or another, would be to
provide for; and she knew now how little she could do
for him alone. Even her desire to "show" Richenda
Earle had now passed. She wanted, desperately wanted,
all the things she persisted in rejecting. Why was she
becoming morose, disillusioned, devil-may-care? It was
a familiar question now, but as she undressed that night
she asked herself again what it all meant.</p>

<p>She answered herself that there was no mystery about
it. She supposed it happened to every woman. It
meant, of course, the passing of her youth.</p>

<p>But, her head on her pillow, she had her compensating
hour. No need to re-describe its kind; there was now
added again that forced and desperate illusion, of the
unity of herself, her boy, and the man she would have had
his father. She knew she merely abused her fancy and
must suffer for it afterwards, but no matter; if it was a
drug it was a sweet one, and that it might stay with her
a little longer she chose uncomfortable positions that would
keep her awake. She could hear Jimmy's breathing
across the dark room. Jim, Jimmy and herself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was against her own will that, at two o'clock in the
morning, she slept.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">IV</p>

<p>It was his voice over the telephone of the Models' Club
that broke the long silence. Ten chances to one but
the bell had rung in an empty room, for, save for a woman
who was washing the hall floor, Louie was alone in
the place. She unhooked the receiver. "Hallo!" she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
called.... "Yes, this is the Models' Club.... This
is Miss Causton...."</p>

<p>At last!</p>

<p>He did not say why he wanted to see her; he only said
that he wanted to do so at once. His minimised voice,
with its suggestion of distance, seemed to her curiously
symbolic of their whole relation. A telephone was supposed
to bring voices near, but far more than that the
smallness and the distance struck her.</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid not," she continued to speak into the
instrument, "but I can give you dinner here. You know
the address?... Yes, at seven.... All right...."</p>

<p>Seek him? No, she certainly would not seek him. He
must come to her. She could give him tea and chops.
As she hung up the receiver again she glanced at
the clock over the little service counter. Eleven. Eight
hours.... She had waited for months, now she must
wait another eight hours. She could have faced the
months again with more composure.</p>

<p>Only to look at the advertisements in the papers had she
come to the Club that morning at all. Well, she was not
going to answer that clairvoyant's announcement she had
seen in <i>The Telegraph</i> now. Kitty would ask her that
evening whether she had been looking for work, and would
hold up Miriam Levey and her determination as an example;
let her; Louie couldn't be bothered with clairvoyants
and their advertisements to-day.</p>

<p>And Kitty little dreamed how near Louie had more than
once been to showing herself as determined even as
Miriam. Miriam was not the only one who might be
"taken on" at this new Consolidation of Mr. Pepper's
and Jim's, whatever it was. There is such a thing, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
a man doesn't come to you, as a miserable, ignoble yielding
to the ache to go to him. There is such a thing as the
willingness even to keep a door all day for the sake of
seeing him go through it just once. After a certain time
pride becomes a poor staff, and&mdash;but he was coming, in
eight hours. That was why she had refused to dine
with him. Your pride stiffens again when you have just
been on the point of throwing it aside.</p>

<p>She knew that she would be good for nothing for the
rest of the day; in that case she might as well go and see
her father. She had money enough for her bus fares;
half-past one found her at the Molyneux Arms.</p>

<p>Buck was in high feather. His name had been proposed,
in the interests of Church and State, as a candidate
for the Borough Council; and the chief plank of the platform
which Buck occupied during the whole of that afternoon,
descending from it with the greatest reluctance only
when Louie vowed that she could not stay another moment,
was that as long as England had Queensberrys to make her
P.R. Rules it didn't matter what Radicals tried to make
of her laws. Louie fondled his silver hair; dear old dad!
Then she made him drive her back to Chelsea.</p>

<p>(Buck, by the way, was returned at the head of the poll,
a few weeks later, amid acclamations that might well have
rendered him deaf in his other ear also.)</p>

<p>Back in the Club once more, Louie set aside the best
chop, and made a tour of the place in search of the narrowest
table. The one she chose was so narrow that the
backs of the two chairs she turned up against it almost
touched. Lightheartedly she rebuked Myrtle Morris, who
asked her whether she was expecting "a boy"; and she
laughed as Myrtle went off to tell another girl that "Causton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
was on the warpath." Her warpaint consisted of a
white blouse, low and perfectly plain at the neck, and a
navy blue skirt. She was waiting at the window for
Jim twenty minutes before he came.</p>

<p>She had schooled herself to a rigorous composure. She
opened the door for him and told him to mind the hall
lamp, within an inch of which his hat reached; and the
hand she gave him was not gloved this time. But she
barely touched his hand; had she not two whole hours before
her? He put aside a cheap hanging of rustling beads
for her to pass, and then followed her into the large room
on the left of the hall, empty save for a piano and a few
chairs, that was used for parties and tableaux. Myrtle
and another girl appeared for a moment in the doorway;
the minxes appeared to be waltzing, but they had come to
see who "Causton's boy" was; and as they sat down she
asked him, as if daring him to find any but the plainer
meaning in it, how Billy Izzard was. She exulted that
she could say these things and he could not. Then she
was told that their chops were ready. They passed into
the next room.</p>

<p>The table&mdash;it was a flimsy card-table covered with a
cheap traycloth stiff with starch&mdash;accounted for all awkwardnesses
and proximities; again she found it secretly
delicious to murmur a demure apology for its smallness.
She lingered over the eating of her chop merely because
her plate was edge to edge with his; she would manage
badly if she could not keep him at least two hours! Then,
when she could linger out her eating no longer, she asked
him for a cigarette and a light&mdash;for in the studios she had
learned to smoke. He gave them to her. Her lids hovered
as he held the match; she wondered whether she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
should look straight into his eyes or keep her lids downcast.
In the end she did both, looking at him first, then
down. Whether he looked at her at all she did not know;
the first at any rate was a miss. She did not ask for a
second match (she had, she told herself, some shame); instead,
she put her elbows on the table and said, without
further delay: "Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>She nodded as he began to tell her; it seemed to be
pretty much what she had expected. She listened, or half
listened; she would not have sworn, had he challenged her,
that her attention did not wander a little. Her thoughts
were ahead of his, but a little patience&mdash;he would catch
up; he would see presently that what his wife might think
or what she might not think (for that was what he was
talking about) was of less practical importance than he
supposed. Naturally his wife must be thinking this and
that; marriage that left such a thing as a&mdash;call it a private
execution&mdash;out of the calculation might even turn out to be
a little difficult; but she might as well hear what he had to
say about it. She waited for the cropping up of the names
of Miriam Levey and Kitty Windus; they duly appeared.
Mrs. Jeffries, it seemed, wanted to see Kitty, and Miriam
Levey wanted her to do so. Why they wanted these things
was not very clear, but possibly, if Louie was giving him
only half her attention, Jim was not saying all he knew
either. He still considered that aspect of the affair to be
wholly and solely the problem: but no doubt he would
wake up by-and-by.</p>

<p>Suddenly she asked him whether he and his wife had
quarrelled. He shook his head that apparently, in spite
of its stupidity, she must still love.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh no."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And on he went again, still quite a number of leagues
behind&mdash;the complication of his former engagement to
Kitty, Evie's sense of unexplained things, Miriam Levey,
her voracious curiosity, her presence at this new Consolidation.</p>

<p>But here she interrupted him. "One moment. When
do you start&mdash;this Consolidation?"</p>

<p>He was toying with a knife; the little reflection passed
over his massive face as he turned the blade. "In a few
weeks. Why?"</p>

<p>"You don't intend to take Miriam Levey over with
you?"</p>

<p>He put the knife down with a little slap. "I do not,"
he said. Louie had thought as much. So, no doubt, in
spite of what she seemed to have said to Kitty, had Miriam
Levey.</p>

<p>"Well, go on; I interrupted you," she said.</p>

<p>He went on. It seemed to her that if nothing had
actually happened his overcarefulness was the one way
likely to bring it to pass. Then, she supposed, he would
ring her up on the telephone again.</p>

<p>By this time she was thinking far more of Miriam
Levey's empty chair at the new Consolidation than she
was of things unaccounted for between her guest and his
wife.</p>

<p>And as for those unexplained things (Louie neither
knew nor cared what they might be), she could only tell
him now what she had told him that night when they had
walked together, that wives must either be wives or not,
must be told things or else be something less than wives.
Perhaps she had not put it quite so plainly to him as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
before, but that was what it had amounted to. Men with
secrets ought to marry the right women.... She stole a
daring look at him across the table. He was mumbling
and twiddling a spoon now. His shoulders, bigger than
Buck's, were clothed in an exquisite iron-grey cloth; she
wondered whether he knew that she had kissed one of
them that night in a Chelsea doorway.... And then,
as he paused and looked up, she spoke. She did so almost
curtly. If not telling hadn't answered, she said, she
could only suggest, once more, telling. As for Kitty, he
might put her entirely on one side; as long as she remained
with Louie, Louie would answer for her.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, he seemed to show a gleam of
interest in her affairs. He asked her how she got her
living, now.... Her pulse quickened. Billy had told
him, then; by "now" he meant now that she no longer
sat; and his eyes avoided hers. He coloured; apparently
he thought he was doing her an honour in wiping out all
memory of that discovery in Billy's studio. An honour!
She could have laughed at him. He little knew how she
longed to tell him more&mdash;to tell him about the oyster-grey
too&mdash;to tell him that for her it was as long ago as that.
But no, he had seen the pearl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And it appeared that his talk really had an object now;
but, as usual, she had seen the drift of it before he had.
He was thinking of Miss Levey's place, if his absurd
delicacies would only allow him to get it out.</p>

<p>"Would you accept it?" he managed at last to ask,
sounding her earnestly with his eyes.</p>

<p>"Steady, silly woman," she whispered to herself,
brightly flushing....</p>

<p>But, glancing at him, she suddenly winced. Twice before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
men had offered her posts, at more than their market
value, and there had been no colour in her cheeks as she
had refused them; had she coloured now at the quick
thought that if <i>he</i> had made such an offer she might
perhaps...? If so, there was mortification and
despite in her colour. Why did he offer her Miss Levey's
place? Was it his wife again&mdash;always his ninny of a
wife? If that was so, so much the worse for him; it was
time he learned that if he got into a mess he must make
shift to get out of it again. There was a new little twang
in her voice as, suddenly looking into his eyes, she said:
"You've no right to expect that of me!"</p>

<p>And as soon as the words were spoken, she saw too where
she herself stood, and to what point beyond she was prepared
to go. She knew now that she would have taken
his job, not at added wages, but without wages at all.
But to the humiliating thought that he imagined himself
to be doing her a kindness was now superadded that of his
entire ignorance that she might be making an attack upon
his faithfulness at all. Suddenly she saw herself merely
wonderful to him&mdash;<i>she</i> wonderful!&mdash;she, who had
thought she could spend all her life up in the clouds, be
content to be magnanimous for magnanimity's sake, virtuous
for the mere love of virtue! Oh, if that was all, he
needn't think <i>that</i> any longer! Wonderful?... What
she wanted was not wonderful at all, oh dear, no: merely
something common, coarse, filling; nothing more wonderful
than that.... Wise mother, to have known that that
was the end of it all, and to have taken, long ago, in
Henson's studio, the short cut! She did not even try to
check a wild little exclamation....</p>

<p>And he evidently saw something too, though what, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
blundered deeper, she did not stop to inquire. He gave a
groan. "Poor woman!" he said compassionately.</p>

<p>He might just as well have set a spark to a fuse. There
broke from her a peremptory cry.</p>

<p>"Not that, Jim&mdash;that's the one thing I will <i>not</i> bear&mdash;I
will <i>not</i> be called 'poor woman'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the rest now had to follow. It was the sum of her
broodings, resentments, hatreds, dreams, desire, despair.
Evie, him, herself&mdash;oh, it was not her fault if he didn't
see now how the three of them stood. He knew only too
well what he wanted: what Louie wanted she also knew
only too well. Except to offer her a job that would save
him even the trouble of ringing her up on the telephone
when her help was required, had he ever, until this moment,
looked at the thing from her point of view? He
had not. She would help him still; but if their ships
must part like this, at least no false tidings should pass
from bridge to bridge: he should know exactly what it
was he asked, and why she gave it! She began to speak
rapidly, uncertainly, but sparing him nothing. Perhaps,
after all, she said, his wife would understand; he had only
to tell her that her husband made away with her sweetheart;
perhaps she could bear it; if she couldn't well&mdash;he
knew what was his for the holding up of a finger....</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as she had begun, she stopped. Her
voice dropped. "I've had no luck," she said, with quiet
bitterness. "I'm out of it, and there's no more to say.
Give me a match."</p>

<p>And then she rose. He might sit there if he liked.</p>

<p>He rose too, and they walked down the room in silence
together. The bead screen of the hall parted and tinkled
together again behind the great church-door of his back.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Without a word he took down his coat and, under the
coloured hall lamp, hoisted himself into it. And then he
looked at her.</p>

<p>Already in her heart she knew that that look was the
end. Her offer had been rejected. Whatever else might
happen, she, Louie Causton, would never come between
him and his wife. The woman who had those eyes would
keep their looks; had it been Louie's fortune to have them,
she would have kept their looks. He was a plotter, but
not of amours; a carrier through too, but not of intrigues.
So grave an innocence was his that probably he didn't
know that his look told her all this; if so, it was final indeed.</p>

<p>So she took her dismissal, and then, with her hand on
the letter-box of the door, stood gazing meditatively on the
ground. She had wanted to be wooed; failing that, she
had once more brought herself to woo; and this Joseph
had gravely repelled her.</p>

<p>At last she looked up.</p>

<p>"About what you were saying&mdash;I mean that place of
Miss Levey's," she said. "I don't think it would do&mdash;not
now."</p>

<p>The man who could plan a murder but not an affair
looked humbly up.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he murmured. It was as if he said: "I
don't remember that meetings of ours in Billy's studio;
I forget this too. You see how it is. Your taking the
job would make no difference."</p>

<p>Slowly she shook her head. "I should be seeing you,"
she said. "It wouldn't do. Good-night."</p>

<p>She saw that she had missed even more than she had
imagined.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, before Christmas came, she was at that self-same
Consolidation. In October a lofty refusal; in December
a creeping back again with her tail between her
legs. Where, she asked herself, was her pride now?</p>

<p>The answer was that that had been in October, and this
was December.</p>

<p>When she told Kitty that she was succeeding to Miss
Levey's place Kitty had certain things to say about
treachery and broken friendships. She said them at some
length, and then remarked that after that of course Louie
could hardly expect her to stay with her.</p>

<p>"You never liked her," she said, as if not to like Miss
Levey was an offence in itself. "And I know you tried
to keep me from seeing her. Oh, you think I don't notice
things, but you never made a greater mistake; I could tell
you things that would surprise you! You and James
Jeffries have got some game on; don't tell me he didn't
give her the push; Evie and Miriam both say so; oh,
you're a deep one, Louie Causton! First you come between
me and Miriam; and then that day your father
came and I was asking him about black eyes and he told
me you could have one <i>without</i> having one till you came
to blow your nose&mdash;oh, <i>I</i> watched you! And then to go
worming about till you got Miriam fired and then bag
her job yourself! Thank goodness, some people have better
ideas of friendship than that! I have, for one.
Never mind the bit you owe me; you can pay Carter Paterson
with it and we'll call it quits. Perhaps it wouldn't
be troubling you too much to ask you if you knew where
the luggage labels are?"</p>

<p>So Louie let her go. The tract she received by post on
the following day: "God's Eye Everywhere, or No Sins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Secret," she dropped into the fire. Even if Kitty really
was groping blindfold on the track of that stale old private
execution, Archie Merridew didn't matter now. The
question had already entered the stage of blank fatality.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">V</p>

<p>Louie did not succeed to Miss Levey's chair at once.
Somebody else got that, who made room for somebody
else, who made room for Louie. And her arrival
at the Consolidation appeared to be the signal for Jim's
almost immediate departure from it&mdash;that is to say, she
saw him for three weeks, then missed him for some days,
asked (in another week or so) a question, and was told that
a fall of some sort, supervening on many weeks of concentrated
work, had necessitated a trip to Egypt. She
hinted that she would like to know what his fall had been,
but nobody seemed able to tell her. As a matter of fact,
she never knew. It was merely an act of spite on the part
of the stars against herself.</p>

<p>The ordeal by absence began again.</p>

<p>This time she was able, somehow, to endure it. She
always remembered him when she passed a shipping company's
office, with a model of a liner in the window and
pictures of palms and pyramids and a sphinx not altogether
unlike himself looming up out of the tawny sand;
but at other times she well-nigh forgot him for whole
days together. She could hardly question her immediate
superior, a Mr. Whitlock, about him, and probably Mr.
Whitlock could not question Sir Julius Pepper&mdash;for Mr.
Pepper was made a knight in the new year. Sir Julius
had altogether too much <i>nous</i> and urbanity to be questioned;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
he asked, not answered, questions. Such an indiscretion
would have stamped Mr. Whitlock himself as
a man of a barbarous mind.</p>

<p>The place itself, its plate glass and marble, its gilded
lifts and high galleries and lofty central dome, its floes of
desks and counters and the tessellated floors over which
rubber-tyred trollies ran to the strong-room every night&mdash;astonished
Louie. What had been consolidated, who the
men had been who had reconciled interests so great that
the mere overcoming of their mass and inertia must have
been accounted a wonder, she never really knew. Perhaps
nobody really knew; perhaps not so much men as
forces had accomplished that task. In some of its aspects
the concern was a huge amalgamation of mercantile companies,
mostly railway and shipping; in others it more
nearly resembled a Government Department. But she
knew that Jim knew all about it. Jim, Mr. Stonor (Mr.
Whitlock's junior) told her, and Sir Julius, had planned
the whole enterprise. Acting alone, Mr. Stonor said, Jim
might have done the work and then have been shouldered
out of the rewards by such bustling men as Robson, of
the Board of Trade, George Hastie and Sir Peregrine
Campbell, and others to whom Louie had lifted up her eyes
when she had kept the appointment-books for the photographer
in Bond Street; but Sir Julius had seen to that&mdash;trust
Sir Julius! Sir Julius could cut a throat smiling
with the best of them; if Jim was the genius, Sir Julius
was the impresario of the enterprise. And by-and-by,
from the frequency with which Sir Julius and other potentates
said, when puzzled: "What d'you suppose Jeffries
would do?" or "Why the deuce isn't Jeffries here?"
Louie came to much the same conclusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>At first she was set to work with twenty other girls who,
each sitting under a porcelain-shaded incandescent that
burned all day long, tapped typewriters in the back part
of the building that looked down on the white-tiled well;
and for some weeks it was a question whether she kept her
job or not. For she was dreadfully inefficient, and daily
expected a reduction to the level of the girls who, with
rigid "dolly-caps" clamped round their heads, manipulated
the rubber worms of the big telephone switchboard.
But again her improved French served her turn. Miss
Lingard, who sat in Miss Levey's chair behind a screen
twenty yards away, was absent one day; Mr. Stonor haled
Louie off to Sir Julius's room; and Louie, following Sir
Julius and a Frenchman from one to another of the
spring-roller maps with which the room was lined, took
down in English short-hand a conversation in French
about the boundaries of some concession or other. It was
a badly botched job, but it was initialled and passed; and
Sir Julius, who did not so much open doors and place
chairs as allow it to be discovered that doors were opened
and chairs placed exactly when they should have been,
looked at Louie, thanked her, and presently sent for her
again. One night she had to wait on him after dinner
at an hotel, to make notes of certain conversations; and
perhaps Sir Julius noted the little dipping of Louie's
mouth when she was summoned from the ante-room where
she had been kept waiting. She wondered whether he had
expected she would turn up in a dolly-cap. A little after
that he asked her out to dinner, without any business excuse
at all. Presently she was wondering whether she
would have to walk out of the Consolidation or else to
tell Sir Julius Pepper not to be a fool.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>It never came to that; exactly how near it was to doing
so, Louie never knew. It was her Uncle Augustus of all
people who saved the situation. His name came up;
Louie could not restrain a sour little smile; and "Do you
know Lord Moone?" Sir Julius asked. "Oh yes,"
Louie replied. That was all. Sir Julius's charming smile
never varied. But the case was altered. Amanuenses
of sorts are one thing, ladies with private information
about the peerage another. Perhaps Sir Julius was a
little of a snob. At any rate, he did not allow his little
gallantries to interfere with business.</p>

<p>So Louie became a quite superior writer of Pitman's
shorthand. The weeks passed. Jim still remained
away.</p>

<p>Nor had she any news of Kitty Windus, of Miriam
Levey, nor yet of Evie Jeffries. She still, however, remained
good friends with Billy Izzard. It was from
Billy that she heard, one night in April, something that
filled her with a vague and ineffectual trouble.</p>

<p>She had gone up to his place in Camden Town, intending
to spend an hour or so with him; but five minutes was
all the time Billy had to spare for her. He was just off
to Victoria to meet a fellow, he said; if she was going that
way they could go together; and she needn't think he was
going to leave her in the studio to steal his sketches.
"One of our heroes just come back from South Africa,
a fellow called Lovenant-Smith," he said. "Coming?"</p>

<p>"I'll go with you as far as Charing Cross," said Louie.</p>

<p>Before she left Billy at Charing Cross she had learned
quite a lot about his friend, Mr. Lovenant-Smith. There
was nothing especially heroic about Roy's homecoming;
no doubt his work had been useful, but it had not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
fighting; for a year and a half he had not left Cape Town.
He had now come into money, and was handing in his
papers; he would hunt and manage his estate somewhere
down in Shropshire. "I shall go and stop with him,"
said Billy. "I only hope his horses are better than that
old yacht he nearly drowned the pair of us in." And at
Charing Cross he left Louie.</p>

<p>Roy was back home, then.</p>

<p>Well, it made not one atom of difference. Jim away
was all to her, Roy in England nothing. No doubt it was
wicked.</p>

<p>So much the worse for Louie.</p>

<p>Then, not a week later, Jim returned from Egypt.</p>

<p>But he returned only to go away once more, this time to
Scotland. She saw him, for just one moment, coming out
of Sir Julius's room. He was very brown, but much
thinner, and he had a new overcoat. He went straight
on to Scotland that day. Mr. Stonor said that he intended
to stay there for the rest of the summer. "Overwork,
of course," said Mr. Stonor.</p>

<p>So yet another absence in her story of absences began.</p>

<p>She filled it chiefly with work. She rarely got home
before ten, and, save on Saturdays and Sundays, had to
leave Jimmy entirely to the young woman who had succeeded
Céleste. Billy had left town, and had probably
gone to stay with Roy in Shropshire. Of Councillor
Causton she now saw little. She wished she could save
more money. Jimmy was now five and a half years old.</p>

<p>Then, in October, Jim returned from Scotland. Louie
half expected that it would be she who would have to
leave now, but this did not happen. Not that she saw
much of him; he did not come until eleven, and went home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
again for tea. Sometimes, after he had left, she or Mr.
Stonor had to ring him up at his house in Well Walk,
Hampstead; for the rest, he remained in high seclusion.
She was glad it was so. A half absence such as this had
not all absence's pangs, nor was his half presence too much
perturbation; she could take a command with calmness,
and she had nothing but commands to take. She knew
by this time that he had a second child, a little girl, and
that seemed definitely to close and bar the door against
any wild and lawless hopes she might ever have entertained.
And so things went on until early in December.</p>

<p>The thing that entirely changed their course may have
seemed an accident to Jim, but a little reflection made it
plain enough to Louie. She had not seen Evie Jeffries
since that afternoon when they had met at the step of the
bus opposite the Adam and Eve; and Evie's whole face
and manner gave the lie to the story she told when, at a
little after three o'clock one afternoon, Louie came upon
her in the counting-house of the Consolidation itself.
Near the table with the calculating machines Louie heard
a clerk whisper: "Mrs. Jeffries!" Forty pairs of eyes
were furtively watching her over desk-rails and glass
screens. Some of the clerks even made errands in order
to get a better view of her. If she wanted her husband
she had only to ask to be taken to his room at once, but she
stood, a slender figure in new black furs, by a waiting-room
door. Then, seeing Louie, she almost ran to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, how are you?" she cried, in an acquired voice,
touching Louie's hand then dropping it again. "Really,
this place almost terrifies me! I came to fetch my husband
home to tea&mdash;the car's outside&mdash;but of course I
know I'm early. I'd such a lot of shopping to do, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
got through it quicker than I thought. Well, how are
you?"</p>

<p>It seemed to Louie that she did not do it very well; the
manner of the <i>grande dame</i> was the last thing she ought to
have attempted. As Evie put up her hand as if it held an
invisible quizzing-glass, Louie wondered whether she had
come primarily to see her husband at all.</p>

<p>"Really, this is stupendous!" she said. "I wonder if
you could show me round&mdash;that is, unless I'm interfering
with your duties? Do tell me what these things are!"</p>

<p>They were the mechanical calculators; her comment on
them was: "How quaint!" Followed by eyes, Louie
took her to the lifts; she said they must have one like
that put into the new house they had taken in Iddesleigh
Gate. "It used to belong to Baron Stillhausen&mdash;you've
heard of Baron Stillhausen, the famous diplomat?" she
said. From the lifts Louie took her to the department
where the girls in dolly-caps pulled at the snaky telephone
plugs. "Oh," she exclaimed, "so <i>this</i> is where you talk
to my husband in the evenings from, is it?"... Louie
had a little start.... She answered, however, that the
private line was in another place, and led the way. No,
Evie Jeffries oughtn't to attempt this kind of thing; her
touch was too heavy. She told more about herself than
she ascertained about anybody else. As they left the
private line Louie somehow had the impression that Evie
Jeffries was counting the paces from Louie's chair to her
husband's room.</p>

<p>She returned to her own place slowly. She wished Evie
Jeffries had not come. Her coming seemed all at once to
have diminished Louie's composure; it was as if a closed
question had been clumsily opened again. "Where do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
you live? I should like to come and see you," Evie had
said, as they had parted at the door of Jim's room; and
that was odd, since for quite a number of years Evie
Jeffries, had given no sign that she wanted to visit her.
Kitty Windus, yes; Miriam Levey, yes; but she had not
wanted to see Louie Causton. But she wanted to see
Louie now, and had come that afternoon, Louie was now
convinced, expressly to see her. Why? Had Jim been
talking? Had Kitty and Miriam Levey been talking?
Louie did not know. She only knew that she had been
settled and at peace and was now so no longer.</p>

<p>And through it all shone an unquenchable recollection&mdash;the
recollection of how she had once stumbled upon Evie
Soames, not in wonderful furs, asking for her lordly husband,
but dressed in a skirt and blouse, cheek to cheek
in a dark back room with a fancy-stationer's son.</p>

<p>Evie would never forgive her that discovery.</p>

<p>With all the elasticity gone out of her, she resumed the
work she had left half-an-hour before.</p>

<p>But as she lay in bed that night in her little flat, Louie
ate her heart out again. She hated Evie Jeffries. She
had remembered, too, an old, old slander&mdash;the slander to
know the truth about which Kitty Windus had come to
the Nursing Home in Mortlake Road. Was it that that
had brought Mrs. Jeffries to the Consolidation now?</p>

<p>Louie tossed and tossed. Oh, she cried vindictively,
if it only <i>had</i> been so.... But to have to submit to the
indignity of Evie's jealousy and not to be able to give her
grounds for it! And Mrs. Jeffries wanted to see her flat!
Well, she should be welcome. Louie would hardly be at
the trouble to lie about things, but every stick of furniture
in this place in which Jim had never set foot might silently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
lie for her if they would! Would that be to drag Jim in?
Well, let him be dragged in; a woman with a husband like
Jim, to be jealous! Why, with Louie ready and glad to
lose her soul for him, he was the very egotist of faithfulness!
He could not be virtuous without damning Louie
with his grave and candid looks! She could almost have
laughed at him. When all was said, such virtue was a
byword, and the story of Joseph a thing for a quiet smile!
Then Louie's laugh became a cry aloud, that woke Jimmy.
Jimmy went to sleep again, but she was no calmer.</p>

<p>Bitter as spurge was that old story of hers now, and
bitterer still the only moral lesson it now appeared to her
to have. Oh, no doubt there was a deal to say for their
conventional morality, but a pretty moral lesson it was,
after all, that you repented of a history with one man only
when it forbade a second history with another! And she
swore again that that first history should not have stood
in her way; more, far more than that was his own headstrong
virtue, and perhaps that was not all either. She
had been born for him, she knew it; he had had never a
secret from her save those large open secrets that scarce
a woman shared with a man yet; his hands, that could
take life for love, were made to hold her. She knew it in
her soul.... But huge as it was, he didn't see it. He
allowed a pretty face to blind him to it all. "Oh, come,
come!" she had called to him on the only night, of all
those nights, when he and she had walked together; and
his answer had been to take himself away. When she
had kissed his shoulder she had merely kissed the spot
where another woman's head had lain.</p>

<p>Oh, if that slander <i>could</i> only have been true!</p>

<p>She looked at, and almost tossed aside unread, a letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
that came for her in the morning. Not for a single moment
had she slept, and she wanted no letter from Roy&mdash;for
it was from Roy. Still she might as well read it.
She did so.</p>

<p>Billy Izzard was with him; it had come out that Billy
knew her, and he wanted to see her. "I've come back for
you," the letter said, "and I'm not going to let you go this
time. Do write when I can come and see you. Off out
now, but do write." She threw it into the fire. Marry
Roy? She would far rather commit another sin than
such a reparation. The trouble was that she could not
commit the sin.</p>

<p>That morning she was sent for by Jim. As she turned
the handle of his door she was ready to make a bet with
herself about what he wanted her for. She was not mistaken.
He wanted to thank her for showing his wife
round the day before.</p>

<p>His wife&mdash;always and for ever his wife.</p>

<p>"If you feel that you must&mdash;&mdash;" she said, biting her
lip with humiliation and passion.</p>

<p>"It's merely&mdash;&mdash;" he rumbled heavily on....</p>

<p>As if she needed to be told what it "merely" was!
If he cared to hear it <i>she</i> could tell <i>him</i> what was
"merely" the matter with his wife!</p>

<p>"Oh, must you?" she said, quivering under the torture.
He was playing nervously with a pen. "Must I what?"
he said, not looking up.</p>

<p>"Must you do this?"</p>

<p>He looked up. "Shut the door," he said. "Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She listened to him almost scornfully. Again harping
on that informal execution, as if he had been right and not
right, and as if it now mattered one straw whether he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
"told his wife" or not! He was saying something about
a doctor; the doctor, Louie gathered, had said she mustn't
have another shock; what had Louie&mdash;always and for
ever Louie&mdash;to say to <i>that</i>? Louie clutched at her skirt
with both hands.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" she said, clenching the skirt hard.</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"Then ask me again and I'll tell you," she threatened
him.</p>

<p>"I do ask you."</p>

<p>Well, if he would have it.... "She's jealous," said
Louie.</p>

<p>The smile that stole slowly over his face set her almost
beside herself. Even Potiphar's wife was probably not
smiled at. Louie cut short the easy words that accompanied
the smile.</p>

<p>"Then if she isn't, why does she want to come and see
me at my home?" she demanded.</p>

<p>With quite remarkable clumsiness he pretended he had
known his wife wanted this, and smiled again. She
stamped on the ground.</p>

<p>"My good man&mdash;&mdash;" she broke out wildly....</p>

<p>What she said she did not remember very clearly afterwards.
It was spoken less to him than to ease her own
breast. With nothing to give her, he still could not hold
his tongue nor restrain that smile when she told him his
wife was jealous. Jealous?...</p>

<p>Yes, and with a jealousy that could now never pass
away! For, out of absences, silences, refusals, virtues,
smiles, everything, Louie had, after all, secured something
that all the smiling in the world could not take away.
She <i>had</i> the secret he had feared to share with his wife.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
She <i>had</i> the answer to every riddle in his riddle-haunted
eyes. His wife <i>had</i> grounds for her jealousy, after all,
had she but wit enough to know where to look for them.
But she too was hopelessly behind. She too was smelling
at cold scents&mdash;telephones and visits to flats. She
suspected a gross infidelity, and never dreamed of the existence
of one so fatally searching that the other would
have been a mere incident by comparison with it. Little
dullard, how should she? Her conception even of jealousy
was as limited as everything else about her; a call
or two on the private wire at night, and she was found
asking questions at the Consolidation the next day.</p>

<p>And suddenly Louie saw&mdash;fool that she had been not to
see it before!&mdash;why Evie Jeffries wanted to come to her
flat. It was not to see the place and its furniture. It
was to see Jimmy.</p>

<p>Oh, if her boy could only have had eyes like a young
lion!</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">VI</p>

<p>When Kitty Windus had come to Mortlake Road
and had refused to sit down until Louie had told
her the truth about the wanton slander that had linked her
name with Jim's, Louie had dismissed the matter with
amused contempt. But now there seemed something
rather terrible in it. Its author's stamping-out notwithstanding,
for Evie Jeffries it appeared still to live. What
had brought it up anew Louie could not as much as guess,
but there it seemed to be.</p>

<p>"So that's it?" she muttered to herself. "In that case
I may certainly expect to see you again soon. You won't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
say anything to your husband; he'd only smile and disbelieve
his eyes and ears if you did&mdash;his powers that way
are really tremendous; but you'll probably go to Miriam
Levey, who's rather a gift for these things, and Kitty'll
back her up, and you'll make out your case one way or another.
Very well. When the water's troubled there's the
best fishing. <i>I'm</i> not above certain things now; good gracious,
no! I'll find a reason for ringing him up to-night,
and if you go to the telephone yourself so much the better.
And you'll be round to see me at my flat before very long."</p>

<p>Evie delayed to come, but Louie knew the reason for
that. Jim was moving into his great new place in Iddesleigh
Gate. That would take a little time. Well, there
was no hurry. When she did come Louie would be ready
for her.</p>

<p>Did she still hope, if those waters could be sufficiently
troubled, for a catch? Was she in her heart now as resolved
to wreck the peace of Jim's household as formerly
she had been to preserve it? She could hardly have answered
the questions herself. It was Evie, not she (she
told herself), who was going the right way to make a mess
of things; nevertheless, she had only to remember Jim's
smile to feel the tigress stretch itself within her. The
loved fool! Could he go all lengths for love without thinking
that a woman might do the same? Louie could not
kill, as he could, smoothly burying the consequences afterwards,
but she could do other things; and she was not sure
that she couldn't kill too. Ten words, it appeared, would
do it. Jim, who did not fear murder, feared those ten
words; well, men feared one thing, women another, that
was all. She had only to open her mouth where Jim kept
his shut.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>The only thing was that it did not seem a very sporting
thing to do. Jim had taken his risks; she would be taking
none. It was not much, perhaps, but it was enough to
give her pause.</p>

<p>In the meantime she continued to ring Jim up frequently
on the private telephone.</p>

<p>It was on the second Saturday afternoon in April that
Evie at last paid her visit. Louie had sent out Rhoda,
Jimmy's nurse, for the afternoon, and was herself setting
out with the boy for one of their precious jaunts. They
were half-way down the four flights of stairs when she
heard somebody ascending. She and Evie Jeffries met on
the second landing, where the charwoman ceased to whiten
the edges of the stairs.</p>

<p>It seemed to Louie that Evie Jeffries must have a sort
of lucky-bag of greetings into which to dip. She could
hardly have been surprised to meet Louie on Louie's staircase,
but she drew a wrong one for all that.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a sur&mdash;a pleasure!" she cried. "You
see, I promised to come, and here I am! Don't tell me
you're just going out!"</p>

<p>"No; we were only going to the South Kensington
Museum, and I was in two minds about it. Come up,
won't you?" Louie replied.</p>

<p>At first Evie wouldn't hear of it, but even as she spoke
she had ascended another step. They went upstairs again,
and Louie put her key into the lock. "You'll excuse me
a moment, won't you?" she said, as Evie entered. "In
there's my sitting-room."</p>

<p>And she herself, turning along the passage, entered her
bedroom and took that old study of Billy Izzard's from its
paper wrappings. She hung it up on its old nail. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Evie Jeffries wished to see her flat she should see her flat.
Then she returned to the front room that looked away over
the trees and houses to Earls Court.</p>

<p>"So this," said Evie, as she entered, "is your little
boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Jim. Won't you sit down? I'll put the
kettle on and we'll have tea."</p>

<p>She went into the kitchen, filled the tin kettle, and set it
on the gas-ring.</p>

<p>Evie was dressed in an exquisite coat and skirt and an
expensive and wrong hat; silk linings made whispers whenever
she moved; but Louie, who kept her good clothes for
the Consolidation, wore the battered old grey felt hat and
long grey coat in which she had passed from studio to
studio. But she knew that Evie envied her her distinction
of motion. Evie's figure was pretty and "stock,"
charming but with no surprise&mdash;that of a demonstrable
beauty. And the acquired tones had come into her voice
again.</p>

<p>"How ripping up here!" she approved. "Such a
splendid&mdash;view! I wish we had a view like it in Iddesleigh
Gate; but as I told my husband, even money can't
buy a view in London. Delightful! Have you the morning
sun?"</p>

<p>"That's in my bedroom," said Louie. "How did you
come&mdash;by car?"</p>

<p>"No; I felt that I needed the walk. Really people
will be forgetting how to walk soon. Well, at all events,
he's a beautiful boy!"</p>

<p>Louie saw no reason why she should not say, in the
simple French which may more or less be assumed to go
with large houses and cars, that she preferred that the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
himself should not be told so; and then she went into the
kitchen again to smile. She remembered Burnett Minor:
"Voo affectay feele!" she murmured softly. Then she
made tea.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're not quite settled yet?" she said, returning
with the tray.</p>

<p>"Settled! Why, it will take us months!" Evie purred.</p>

<p>"Of course. It seems very odd to talk over the telephone,
though, to a place you've never seen. Sugar? Is
this place at all like what you imagined?"</p>

<p>Again came the ready-made answer: "Oh, it's really
quite too delightful!" It was a pity, Louie thought, that
Mrs. Jeffries had not had the advantage of a few minutes'
talk with Mrs. Lovenant-Smith before coming to see her.
The Lady-in-Charge at Rainham Parva might have warned
her.</p>

<p>But Louie knew that already her very chairs and mats
and brown-papered walls were silently whispering to Evie
Jeffries. She might talk of Iddesleigh Gate, but she was
thinking of nothing less than of Iddesleigh Gate. Perhaps
she had been reassured in the matter of Jimmy's eyes,
which were as blue as Roy's, but her own eyes were taking
in everything for all that. Let them. Louie wondered
whether, did she turn her back for a few minutes, her
visitor would question the child.</p>

<p>"The Amaranth Room?" she presently interrupted
Evie's flow to say. "Have you really a room called that?
How lovely it sounds!"</p>

<p>"Nearly fifty feet long, my husband says; why, it has
to have three large fireplaces, as well as the radiators, but
of course there's steam-heat all through the house. It's
delicious, not to walk into cold patches all of a sudden.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
And all the windows on one side are double, so that the
place is perfectly quiet. You must come some time. Of
course," she took herself up, "our other house was quite
a poky place; my husband never really settled there; but
at Iddesleigh Gate, he says, he can really stretch himself."</p>

<p>Louie meditated for a moment. Then: "What's
really been the matter with him?" she asked. She knew
that Evie would probably not believe she didn't know; for
that reason it was better to ask.</p>

<p>But she got no information. It was overstrain, Evie
replied lightly, and then on the top of that he'd slipped one
night and caught his head on the corner of a fender. He'd
slipped because he'd been really fagged out, what with
starting the Consolidation and one thing and another.
"But he looks all right now, don't you think?" Evie
asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly, I should say, from the little I see of him."</p>

<p>"Of course you mostly do Sir Julius's work, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Mostly."</p>

<p>"It must be great fun for you, being taken out by Sir
Julius sometimes. My husband told me that."</p>

<p>"Quite amusing."</p>

<p>"Miss Levey was never taken out like that!"</p>

<p>"No? Have you seen her lately?"</p>

<p>But again Louie got little information. Included in
what she did get, however, was a lie. Evie reported that
Miss Levey, now at some Women's Emancipation League
or other with Kitty Windus, had actually been going to
write to Louie to suggest that she, Louie, should apply for
her old place. Louie gave a little nod. Of course Miriam
Levey, rather than own to defeat, would pretend that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
had left the Consolidation of her own accord. Louie
rose.</p>

<p>"But perhaps you'd like to see my place?" she said.
"Not that I think you'll find it very amusing. But you
can see it if you like."</p>

<p>"I should love it! Is Jimmy coming? Do you know,
Jimmy, I've got a little boy like you, but not nearly as
big?"</p>

<p>"Has he got a helmet like mine?" Jimmy demanded.</p>

<p>"No; but I think I shall have to get him one."</p>

<p>"You stay here, Jimmy," said his mother; and she led
the way to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Evie praised the kitchen and its meagre appointments,
and was then shown the bathroom. "It hasn't a crystal
bath," Louie said, "but it does to wash in." She lingered
in the bathroom a little; she was thinking of another bath
and certain old jokes about brown-paper parcels. Then,
first showing Evie the bedroom that had been Kitty's,
she passed to her own room at the back.</p>

<p>Against the wall on the left lay Jimmy's bed; her own
was across the room, with its head under the break of the
mansard roof. The little built-out window, from the glass
sides of which rows of chimney-pots could be seen, faced
the door, and over the fireplace on the right, full in the
light, hung Billy's study. It was the second thing on
which Evie's eyes rested. Louie was careful not to look
at it.</p>

<p>For in that place at any rate she was going to strike;
the rest might fall out afterwards as it would. As she
turned away to pat Jimmy's pillow she was suddenly
fighting white; the little creature had come for it and
should have it. And she should have it swiftly and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
warning. Even as Louie had turned her back her
heart had given a leap....</p>

<p>For up to that moment it had been always possible that
Jim had not spoken of his intrusion into Billy's studio
that evening; but there was no doubt now! Jim&mdash;or
perhaps Billy Izzard&mdash;had told her. Probably Billy.
Probably Billy first, and then, seeing she already knew,
Jim. All at once there rushed upon Louie, as she passed
from Jimmy's bed to her own and smoothed the coverlet
of that also, what had happened later that same evening,
when her arms had supported a collapsing Jim in a Swan
Walk doorway and she had passionately called him:
"Come, come! Come, come!"</p>

<p>She spoke quietly; quietness was so much more destructive.</p>

<p>"This is where I get the morning sun. But it's very
windy. The wind blew that picture you're looking at
down the other day." Then, without either pause or
change of tone: "By the way, that's what you came to
see, isn't it&mdash;that and my boy?"</p>

<p>Simultaneously with her blow she was commenting to
herself: "That's good-bye to you, Sir Julius; she'll see
I don't come back to the Consolidation after that; will
you have Miss Levey back again, or will you try her friend
Miss Windus? I don't think you'll offer Miss Windus an&mdash;er&mdash;increase
of wages. As for me, I suppose I can sit
again; nothing matters now. Or there's a plainer way
still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The next moment she had called sharply: "Go away,
Jimmy, till I call for you! Go and look out of the window
for Rhoda!"</p>

<p>Then she turned and faced the woman who had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
two quick, running steps towards her. Insolently she
smiled into her eyes.</p>

<p>"That was it, wasn't it?" she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jeffries did not fight white. The blood had
thronged to her head until her very lips seemed swollen;
Miss Levey could hardly have spoken more thickly. She
spoke, too, in a passionate ellipsis than which Louie's own
five words did not go more straight to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would if you could&mdash;I've known that a long
time!" she cried. "Wouldn't you just&mdash;rather! You'd
do it if it was only to give <i>me</i> one for myself! <i>I</i> know
you."</p>

<p>Louie thought she rather liked her for making a fight
of it. She still smiled. "Then that was it?" she said.</p>

<p>Evie flushed even more deeply. "You didn't suppose
I didn't know all about that absurd meeting, did you?"
she said, with a still darker flush.</p>

<p>"Dear me, no. I've known for weeks that you 'knew'&mdash;if
we mean the same thing. Perhaps we don't, though.
Anyway, I can quite understand your wanting to see for
yourself. Miss Levey can't tell you everything."</p>

<p>Evie's inability to speak for mere fury was so evident
that Louie, after watching her for a moment, continued:</p>

<p>"As for that picture, naturally I wanted to keep it.
I'm sure you'll see that for yourself."</p>

<p>Here Evie flamed. "'Naturally!'" she broke out.
Louie gave an almost humorous shrug.</p>

<p>"Well, surely it's natural?"</p>

<p>"Natural!... As if his coming in wasn't the merest
accident!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that; but what <i>are</i> you here for then?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
And now that you <i>have</i> been and seen, what can you possibly
do about it?"</p>

<p>Evie's lips seemed as thick as if a bee had stung them.
She broke out again.</p>

<p>"'It!'&mdash;I like your 'it,' Miss Causton or Mrs. Causton
or whatever you call yourself!"</p>

<p>Louie coolly smoothed the folds of her blouse. "By
'it,' I mean, of course, my loving your husband," she said.
"As you guessed, I knew that you knew about that picture.
But it's really a much older thing than that! I
don't quite know how old; while you were still engaged to
somebody else&mdash;as old as that anyhow. And as it's purely
my affair, and even he can't stop it, I wonder what <i>you</i> can
possibly do!&mdash;I'm 'Miss' Causton, by the way."</p>

<p>Louie had almost a genius for these last words that could
be taken up; she smiled again as Evie, taking them up,
said: "Oh, <i>are</i> you!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think I need be longer than I like,
but that's neither here nor there. The important thing at
present is whether you were wise to come to-day or not. I
wonder whether you'd let me give you a piece of advice?"</p>

<p>And that, as Evie still stood speechless with rage, might
be described as the end of the first round. There was a
long pause during which the two women stood looking at
one another. Then the second round began, with a rapid
exchange of half sentences.</p>

<p>"Advice! Thanking you very much for your kindness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't raise your voice; they aren't double
windows here."</p>

<p>"Advice is cheap."</p>

<p>"Far from it, believe me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>"You common&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sssh, ssh, ssh! Your husband wasn't above asking
my advice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll take very good care&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;there are other people in these flats."</p>

<p>"Well, is noise anything new here?" said Evie grossly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you really shouldn't say those things!"</p>

<p>And again they fell back, as it were, for breath. It was
Louie who presently resumed.</p>

<p>"I don't in the least know why I should want to advise
you," she went on. "I'd no intention of doing so when
you came into this room, and to be frank I still half hope
you won't take the advice. But you'll please yourself
about that. It's this. Don't be a little fool. Go home,
and don't tell your husband you've seen me at all. If you
do you'll make a sad mistake. You say advice is cheap;
well, this isn't; it's fearfully dear. It's not the first time
I've tried to help you, and I really haven't strength to do it
any more. No, don't try to think of fresh names to call
me either; already you've called me common and told
me that the tenants here are used to hearing angry wives,
and one can have too much of that. So go home, and say
nothing to your husband about where you've been. Believe
me, it'll be quite the best."</p>

<p>It did in truth cost her more, far more, than she had
intended to pay. The greater fool she, she told herself,
but&mdash;she gave a quick, defiant glance round the bedroom,
as if her eyes sought somebody who dared to meddle in her
affairs. She would be a fool if she wished; who should stop
her? This jealous little scold had fair warning now; let
her take it and go while there was yet time. Louie had
all but spoken her former <i>fiancé's</i> name once; with much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
more provocation she might forget herself and involve Jim
too in a catastrophe of ten little words; and she wanted to
do the sporting thing after all. Let Jim's wife take her
fill of that canvas of Billy's, then, and go. Her eyes were
glued to it now. As she looked Louie exulted; it <i>had</i>
been so&mdash;precisely so; not all Evie Jeffries's looking could
alter that fact....</p>

<p>But suddenly, as if even in this gratification and triumph
lurked a peril best avoided, Louie strode to the canvas,
took it from its nail, and set it on the floor by the little
fireplace with its face to the wall. She had felt the tigress
stretch again. To put that thing out of sight was the
safest thing to do. She turned to Evie again.</p>

<p>"Please go," she said. ("Yes, mother's coming in a
minute, Jimmy.) You see, he's calling me. Forgive my
turning you out like this, but do, do go, and don't tell your
husband where you've been. Good-bye."</p>

<p>But Evie Jeffries seemed to suspect that Louie was
merely "coming it over her" with something indefinable,
essential, not to be acquired. After all it was she, this
shabby, grey-eyed woman, who wrote shorthand for a
weekly wage, and herself, Mrs. James Herbert Jeffries,
who lived in the mansion in Iddesleigh Gate. Perhaps
she felt herself challenged; at any rate she plunged her
hand into her lucky-bag once more.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no need for such a hurry," she said frigidly.
"For one thing, I'm a little particular about who I take
my advice from. You needn't think I don't see you're
just shutting me up?"</p>

<p>Louie was almost hushing, soothing. "Then let me
shut you up. You've seen all you came to see; if there's
anything else you want to know, ask me, quite quickly&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>And Louie, in her eagerness to get rid of her and to
remove herself from danger, almost gladly submitted to
what Evie said next.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, if you've&mdash;an appointment," she said,
with a toss.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've an appointment&mdash;you understand," she answered,
with a little shepherding movement of her hands.</p>

<p>But the next moment that too had turned into something
else.</p>

<p>"Oh, you little fool!" Louie broke out, suddenly
seeing. "You don't suppose I'm trying to get you out of
the way so that I can meet <i>him</i>, do you? Good gracious,
woman, he's never set foot in this place in his life, and I'll
see he never does! Perhaps I wanted you to think he had&mdash;I
don't know what I thought&mdash;with one and another of
you I'm getting almost past thinking&mdash;but that's the truth
anyway! <i>Now</i> are you satisfied? Or have you got the
idea so thoroughly into your stupid little head that nothing
will shake it? If you're going to spend your Saturday
afternoons going round to every place you think might
possibly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the denial counted for nothing. Evie turned
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Who's making the noise now? And why should I
believe you? I knew before I came you'd say that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, how you try me!... I <i>do</i> say that. There's
nothing else to say. Do you think if it was any other way
I shouldn't boast of it, to you or anybody else? Why,
how <i>can</i> you know so little of him&mdash;not to speak of
myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't talk as if you hadn't already had the
cheek to tell me you loved him!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>"Did I? Upon my soul, I sometimes don't know
whether I do or not! Say I don't&mdash;say I lied&mdash;say I sometimes
almost hate him as much as I do you and you me."</p>

<p>"Oh, very likely, the grapes being sour," Evie scoffed.</p>

<p>"Then if they're sour&mdash;&mdash;? What more do you want?
Isn't that enough? And isn't it more than enough that I
let you stand there and tell me so? Oh, I'm doing my
best to warn you&mdash;you'll make a great mistake if you make
me <i>try</i> to get him!" She stamped. "<i>Won't</i> you go?"</p>

<p>Evie too stamped. "Oh yes, I'll go, and so will you, I
promise you&mdash;from Pall Mall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anything you like&mdash;only go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But as Evie took a step towards the door a little accident
turned Louie suddenly as white as paper. Billy's study
leaned against the wall; Evie's skirt or foot caught it as
she passed; and the canvas fell. Evie gave a short
laugh and pushed it with her shoe.</p>

<p>The dear symbol, nay, the very evidence of so many
dreamings, that poor thing of wasted smiles and sighs and
tears, the pearl from the heart of the oyster-grey&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A kick of her rival's shoe was treatment good enough
for it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was as if the hives of her own breasts and the heart
beneath them had been trodden on.</p>

<p>Louie stepped slowly forward. "No, stop," she said.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment looking down at the picture;
then she spoke slowly.</p>

<p>"You were quite right to come," she said. "You have
reason to be jealous."</p>

<p>Evie affected not to hear, but she heard. Louie continued:</p>

<p>"A moment ago I told you not to tell him you'd been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
here. Now I want you to tell him. He may even be
expecting it. You see we have spoken of it, he and I."</p>

<p>Evie Jeffries seemed about to say something, but
"Just one moment," said Louie quietly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She placed the picture against the wall again, face outwards.
She did not display it as a taunt now; it had
served its turn. As if Evie's looks had cheapened it, she
no longer wanted it. She stood looking at it.</p>

<p>"It was the last time I sat," she murmured to herself.</p>

<p>Even that pale shadow of a bridal was to be taken from
her.</p>

<p>Well, let it go.</p>

<p>This time it was her own foot that kicked the canvas
aside; then like a flash she turned&mdash;Louie at her deadliest.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're aware you've lost him, whether he
knows it yet or not?" she demanded truculently.</p>

<p>Again she was grateful to Evie that she stiffened up
against her. Evie smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, that way&mdash;'whether he knows it or not'&mdash;nobody
minds <i>that</i> kind of losing! <i>That</i> wasn't what you were
trying to make me believe a few minutes ago. Thank you
very much for the tea, not forgetting the advice," she went
on, "and if I might return the compliment, I should like
to give you a piece of advice too. You say you could get
married if you like; I'd jump at that if I were you! You
see, there's your boy. Quite a well-behaved little fellow
he seems&mdash;quite a superior child&mdash;and now that I've seen
for myself, I'm perfectly satisfied, thank you!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Louie, advancing, "I'm going to spoil
your satisfaction. Listen to me." Her eyes were like
saucers of ice. "You've lost your husband. I'm not going
to tell you how, but I'll tell you how you can find out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
You can tell him what he wouldn't believe when I told him&mdash;that
you're jealous. You've reason; ask him what it is.
If he doesn't tell you, he daren't; if he does&mdash;ck!&mdash;it's all
up between you. Do you suppose," she said slowly, "that
<i>you're</i> the kind of woman men tell things to? You, who
can neither trust him nor be trusted by him? You, who
spy on him when his back's turned? You, who listen
while a miserable little Jewess makes mischief for you&mdash;for
I guess Miriam Levey sent you here? <i>You</i> think you
love him? Look at me, I say"&mdash;she rapped out the words
like a command&mdash;"listen, and I'll tell you <i>my</i> idea of loving
a man! I've messed my life; if you were anything but
what you are you'd know that if you wanted to hurt me
your way wouldn't be to point at my little boy and look
round my bedroom as if you expected to find pipes and
overcoats there! Oh, that's not the way! The way
would be to let me see what a perfect marriage could be;
there might be tears in my eyes then! But what's this
you show me instead? Oh, I know what your marriage
is without telling. It would take you and a woman to
make a wife for a man! And what would mine have been
if I hadn't thrown my chance away? What should I
have said if I'd seen what you think you've seen? Listen!
I should have said: 'Go, if you like; find a woman if you
can whose love's like mine; search the earth for her; I
give you leave, and I shall be waiting for you, just the
same, when you come back and say there isn't one!' But
had <i>you</i> thought of that? Not you! At a word you're off,
asking whether this and that's true, because you don't
trust him; and so he gives his trust to somebody else!
That's what you've lost&mdash;and you don't even miss it, you
know so little of love!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>Evie had fallen back against the wall, a little intimidated
by her vehemence. She did not understand, but
she seemed to apprehend that there was something she did
not understand. Louie broke out anew.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> know love! And when and how did you learn
it, pray? As you learned your shorthand and things (oh,
you're trying hard to forget you ever knew them!) at
that place in Holborn? Why, you failed in your petty
little examinations there; do you think love's easier?
Something you get out of a text-book and answer a paper
on? Your husband might know if you don't! <i>He</i> knew
just what those other lessons were worth, but he doesn't
seem to know that loving has a genius too&mdash;that one in a
million has it as a gift and the others mimic it as you're
mimicking people in your dress and talk now! And you
call <i>me</i> common&mdash;me, who told your husband long ago
what his only, only chance was! Oh, I mustn't say any
more or I shall say everything! And you toss your head
and say: 'Nobody minds that kind of losing!' That's
your idea; that's what you really think! Why, your mind
wants a window as badly as that little dark back room at
your Business College.... Oh, it maddens me, the sheer
waste! A necklace of love&mdash;pearls&mdash;and good gracious,
a bit of cheap glass in the middle of it! Yes, I mean you."</p>

<p>She was walking rapidly up and down; she struck the
rail of Jimmy's cot with her hand as she passed. Evie,
cowed, watched her from the wall. Louie stopped before
her.</p>

<p>"What do you <i>do</i> for him?" she said bitterly. "What
do you <i>give</i> him? What do you <i>bear</i> for him, suffer for
him? Don't whimper&mdash;tell me&mdash;you've made pretty free
with me&mdash;put that handkerchief away and tell me&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>But instead of putting the handkerchief away, Evie
burst into loud sobs. Louie watched her remorselessly.
Tears, of course&mdash;no doubt that was the way she managed
Jim&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's no good with me," she said harshly. "I want
to know what you do for your husband besides following
him about and asking questions about him."</p>

<p>Evie's hand moved as if for a chair. There was none.
She lifted her head, walked across the room, and fell across
Louie's bed. Louie still watched her unmoved.</p>

<p>"Well?" she demanded again, after a quarter of a
minute.</p>

<p>Muffled in the bedclothes, Evie's voice came.</p>

<p>"I give him all&mdash;all I&mdash;have. You talk as if&mdash;as if&mdash;I'd
no right&mdash;to be on the earth at all."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you do&mdash;you do! How&mdash;how can I give him
more&mdash;than I've got? Oh, you think you know, but you
don't&mdash;you don't know what I've gone through&mdash;you've
never had that horrible morning&mdash;when I was to have been
married&mdash;and I never expected Jeff to propose, but he
did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, for goodness' sake, get up!" Louie cried.</p>

<p>"He did&mdash;one day&mdash;and I said No at first, but he caught
hold of me.... And even then I was jealous about
Kitty&mdash;I know I'm jealous&mdash;but he told me afterwards
that I needn't be jealous of poor Kitty because he'd only
done it because he thought he couldn't have me&mdash;I know
I'm jealous&mdash;it hurts sometimes so that I can only cry and
cry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie hadn't wanted this at all. Again she cried: "Oh,
get up!" but Evie continued to sob.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>

<p>"And then when Jeff saw you&mdash;that night&mdash;at Billy's&mdash;it
was worse than ever, but I kept it from him. I'm not
like you, Louie&mdash;it's no good my telling myself I don't
mind&mdash;even though I knew it was all an accident it was
like a knife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't lie there like that!" Louie muttered.</p>

<p>"And then Miriam Levey reminded me of that thing
Archie had said&mdash;but he's dead now&mdash;and I know it was
absurd, but I did think he liked you. You've&mdash;such ways,
you see&mdash;I expect you've been a governess or something in
swell houses&mdash;I've got to learn them too, now, but Jeff
says I'm really very quick at it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie was pacing the floor now, but more slowly and
with downhung head. This was the very last thing she
had wanted. More than ever she hated this unresisting
piece of pulp; but strike again she could not; no, not with
Evie's soul as it were a naked picture for her to set her foot
upon. And unless she did strike it was now quite, quite
final. To take it lying down! Gladly she would have
goaded her into a fresh show of resistance; contemptuously
she would have told her to stand up and fight; but the
child&mdash;Louie felt her to be a child, and herself a faded
woman&mdash;was merely beyond all decency exposed. Louie
only wanted to cover her up again as quickly as possible&mdash;her
confessions, her abjectness, her appalling artlessnesses,
her humiliating appeals. She was beginning to sob once
more.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go on like that; do get up and pull yourself
together!" Louie snapped.</p>

<p>"I do love him&mdash;I haven't anything else to give him&mdash;except
my life&mdash;he could have that&mdash;you couldn't give
him more than that&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>"I could stop blubbering for him," said Louie curtly,
resuming her walk.</p>

<p>Yes, it was final. Evie had overcome; Louie now
backed out of the whole affair. If Jim liked to tell her of
his own accord, well and good; it still seemed the only
way out; but what was the good even then? Evie Jeffries
would no more acquire love as Louie understood it than
she would ever acquire the <i>nous</i> to preside without betrayals
at Jim's table at Iddesleigh Gate. And if Evie
had lost Jim, so had Louie. By her silence she was relinquishing
him now. She saw his image recede, slowly,
slowly, as if it had been indeed that ship of her fancy,
outward bound, her own vessel already condemned for
breaking up. Yes, the ship was drawing away. The eyes
of her spirit tired of watching it; surely now she might
turn them elsewhere; but no&mdash;there it was still, very
small, leaning, no doubt, to a brisk breeze, but hardly
appearing to move.... No, it was not gone even yet;
that sudden anguished searching for it was but a trick of
the eyes; it was still there&mdash;a speck&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And it had only needed six words: "James Herbert
Jeffries killed Archie Merridew."</p>

<p>Suddenly Louie herself sank to the floor by Jimmy's cot.
Evie heard her sinking. She rose from the bed and ran
to her. But Louie cried aloud and put up her hand.</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't touch me&mdash;go now&mdash;and say
nothing."</p>

<p>The touch of Evie Jeffries would have been more than
she could have borne.</p>

<p class="p2">"Mother, there <i>is</i> a gentleman!"</p>

<p>It was Jimmy's voice outside the door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly Louie rose to her feet. "Very well," she called
shakily; "talk to him till I come. Please go at once,"
she added to Evie.</p>

<p>Evie began: "I'm sorry I said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you want me to strike you?"</p>

<p>"Can't I&mdash;do anything&mdash;for you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Go!</i>"</p>

<p>She heard the outer door close behind Evie Jeffries. By
that time her eyes were straining at a wide and empty
horizon....</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">VII</p>

<p class="center b1">§<i>a</i></p>

<p>What followed when, after a few minutes during
which Louie bathed her face in the bathroom, she
entered her sitting-room again, fell mercifully flat. Any
visit would have been an anti-climax; a visit now from Roy&mdash;it
was Roy&mdash;was even welcome for that reason. If she
must see him, best get it over.</p>

<p>He was sitting on a rush-seated chair with Jimmy
between his knees. Jimmy was playing with his watch.
Save that the rims of his stolid porcelain-blue eyes were
pinkish, as if with suppressed tears, he had not greatly
changed. He wore a braided morning-coat; his silk hat,
stick and gloves lay on another chair. His watch slipped
from his boy's hand and dangled by its chain as he rose.
His voice carried Louie instantly back to the carpenter's
shed at Rainham Parva.</p>

<p>"It's me, you see, Louie; here I am, like a bad penny,
always turning up."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>Louie spoke listlessly. "How are you? I'll get you
some tea."</p>

<p>A minute later, with a "May I come in here?" he had
followed her into the kitchen. He merely got in her way,
if she could be said, in her complete exhaustion, to have a
way at all. She was cutting bread and butter.</p>

<p>"Louie, old girl," he said piteously over the bread-board,
"why didn't you&mdash;tell a fellow?"</p>

<p>Louie did not answer. Then Roy chirped up a little,
as if something might now, past all discussion, be taken for
granted.</p>

<p>"Well, this settles it," he said. "Clinches it entirely.
You know what I mean."</p>

<p>Louie did know. "Just take the kettle off, will you?"
she said.</p>

<p>"So you see that's settled&mdash;clinched," said Roy, quite
bustling. "Right you are. The only question now is;
how soon can you pack up."</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it presently, if there's anything to say.
There isn't, though. Will you carry the tray in?"</p>

<p>Jimmy ran straight to his knee again. "May I give
him some jam?" said Roy; and then he added to the boy:
"Oh, come, don't mess yourself up with it like that!"
Louie remembered his account of the accident with the
centre-board: "Jam and all the lot!" but she did not
smile.</p>

<p>"Rhoda will be here in a few minutes, then I'll have a
short walk with you," she said. "I've nothing to say,
though."</p>

<p>Presently Rhoda did come in, and Louie put on her hat
and old grey coat. They went out and walked slowly
across Eelbrook Common towards Walham Green. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
she told Roy that his return could make no difference
whatever. "Don't talk such stuff, Louie," he said; "sit
down." They sat down on a bench on the side of the common
past which the District Railway runs and talked.</p>

<p>The air rang with the shouts of poorly clad children at
their Saturday afternoon play; the common was a-crawl
with urchins. Into Roy's honest, statue-like eyes tears
had come; none came into Louie's. She only shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You're only lacerating me," she said.</p>

<p>"But, Louie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You want to lacerate me?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the little chap&mdash;&mdash;" Roy said presently, with
a gulp. "Will you tell a fellow how you manage?"</p>

<p>That Louie did not mind doing, more or less. "And
now I must go back," she said, rising.</p>

<p>"I'll walk back a bit of the way with you. I'm not
going to let you go like this."</p>

<p>At the little drinking-fountain she stopped. "Don't
make it harder," she said. He had been indicating the
rabble of children.</p>

<p>"But look at 'em, poor little beggars!" he said. "Dash
it all, I'm not just blowing off&mdash;I <i>could</i> do such lots for
him&mdash;he could ride&mdash;and shoot&mdash;and fish&mdash;and I've a
corking little pony at grass now." He mentioned these
things one after the other, slowly, as they occurred to him.</p>

<p>Louie groaned inwardly, but aloud she said: "Please
don't come any farther. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"But I may come again? You see, I jolly well know
I could persuade you."</p>

<p>"N-o&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall, though&mdash;you bet," Roy announced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>She left him, wondering whether it would have made any
difference at all had he, in asking her to marry him, told
her once, even once, that he loved her.</p>

<p>But she did not return home. Instead, she walked past
the block of flats, crossed Putney Bridge, and sought her
old Nursing Home in Mortlake Road. As a drunkard
might pant for a drink, so now in her extremity she wanted
to hear gaiety and laughter and talk. Though she paid for
it in prostration afterwards, she felt that without some such
intermission she could never get through the night. And
to-morrow was that dead day, Sunday. Further than that
she did not see; beyond the anodyne of an ordinary human
laugh she did not inquire. It seemed to her a matter of the
last moment to herself that Miss Dot and Miss Cora should
be at home; if they were not, she felt that she must walk
straight into a public-house, as a man might, and get herself
something to drink.</p>

<p>But Miss Cora and Miss Dot were at home; they had
just come in from a matinée. They made an onslaught on
Louie. Had she seen the piece? Oh, the funniest thing!
They really had had some luck at the theatre at last!
The last time it had been a slum piece, all heartstrings and
gutter-snipes; and the time before that&mdash;would Louie
believe it!&mdash;just when they had expected to see frocks and
dancing and suchlike, the curtain had gone up on a dentist's
parlour! Two half-crowns for seats in the pit for that!
It was almost like paying money to go and see another
Nursing Home!</p>

<p>"But give the poor girl some tea&mdash;what are we thinking
of!" said Miss Cora.</p>

<p>"No, thanks&mdash;I've given two people tea this afternoon
already," said Louie. "Tell me about the play."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>And, both speaking at once, they told her about the
play&mdash;<i>such</i> a frock as Ellaline Terriss had worn!&mdash;an
e-<i>nor</i>-mous pink hat, pink like a rabbit's ear, and a frock,
chiffon over pink satin.</p>

<p>Ah! That was better!</p>

<p>"But where's my bonnie boy?" Miss Cora demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's show her the new one, the little Crowley
baby!"</p>

<p>The little Crowley baby was brought in....</p>

<p>"May I invite myself to supper?" Louie asked by-and-by.</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop!"</p>

<p>"Then give me some stout or something. I'm not sleeping
very well."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll see that's all right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And when, at ten o'clock, Louie left, it was with a sleeping
preparation in her pocket. She took it in bed. It did
its work. Half Sunday had passed when next she awoke.</p>

<p>On the Sunday afternoon she went with Jimmy and
Rhoda to Bishops Park; then, packing them off home, she
crossed the bridge again and took the bus to Buck's. At
Buck's she again stayed until ten, and she smiled as, on
the way home again, she remembered the little party to
which Chaff had once taken her, pigtail and all. If Chaff
had had a little party that night she would have invited
herself to it; it would have been something to do. Although
it was half-past eleven when she reached her own
door she was not in the least tired; had she not slept until
well after midday? She walked back to Putney Bridge
again. There a man spoke to her. She wondered what
he would have said had she stopped; it would have been
amusing to know. She felt that she had not had enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
amusement. She wished she could have gone back to the
Business School in Holborn again. That had been amusing.
Mr. Mackie had been very amusing. One of his
songs, he had said, that about the Gorgonzola Cheese, never
failed to create merriment.</p>

<p>She hummed as much as she could remember of the air
of it as she walked, and took two more of Miss Cora's
sleeping-tablets before going to bed.</p>

<p>She found, too, an entirely unexpected amount of amusement
at the Consolidation on the Monday morning. Not
that everything was not much as usual; the routine was
the same; but a quite comic spirit seemed to pervade the
whole place. Lacking a Mr. Mackie, Sir Julius, dapper
and perfect in his aplomb, who had thought of asking her
to be his mistress but had found a more profitable use to
put her to, seemed somehow as funny as needs be; she
wondered she had not noticed it before. It happened that
Mr. Stonor had to rebuke one of the telephone girls that
morning; there was diversion in the way in which the
girl tossed her dolly-capped head and told him that she
would talk to her "boys" if she liked. Quite right; that
was the way to take things, as a joke. And Mr. Whitlock
was portentously funny over a nought or so that had
strayed into a pile of figures; and the glazed screen that
marked Louie's superiority to the other girls in the same
room seemed inanimately funny, and Jim himself was
funny, when you came to think of it, sitting invisible there
in his room with people coming and going all the time, as if
the earth would have ceased to revolve on her axis or the
sun have omitted to rise if Jim had not rung bells and
jotted his initials on his bits of paper. And funnier than
everything else was the fact that Louie should be there at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
all. She laughed outright when, at nine o'clock that night
(she had been kept on account of some urgent joke or
other), she stepped from the upholstered lift and out into
Pall Mall.</p>

<p>Again she wished that Chaff had had a little party somewhere.
Jim, she understood from Mr. Stonor, was giving
a party presently, not a little one, but a large, probably
a screamingly funny, one. But its humour would probably
be lost on Jim. Jim did not always see jokes; that was
where Jim had made the mistake; he needed somebody to
point them out to him. His wife, being part of the comedy
herself, naturally could not do so; she cried when she
should have laughed; she had no "kick," no "buck," in
her. It was a pity, for Jim needed these things, and ought
to have married a woman who had them. Well, it was
rather late, but not too late for Louie to go into a shilling
gallery somewhere. To-morrow, if she could get away
early, she would go up to Camden Town and see Billy.
Billy was a joke too, spending whole, real days in making
artificial coloured shapes on canvases or solemnly scratching
his copper plates. One of the best things Billy had
ever done a woman had humorously kicked aside with her
foot. That showed what these things were worth in the
big, big world. Of course a sense of humour was really
a sense of proportion. The dreadful lack of it showed
when people magnified trifles so. Yes, she would go and
see Billy to-morrow. To-night, the theatre gallery.</p>

<p>She found Billy on the following evening, still etching,
the humorous fellow, but amusingly grave too. Perhaps
he had heard, or guessed, something from Roy. He was
dissolving the ground from a plate; Louie wondered what
the curiously sweet-smelling fluid he was using was; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
then she remembered. She had smelt that same smell
when Jimmy had been born&mdash;which event also, by the way,
had been the consequence of a lark. She remembered,
too, the wonderful, releasing sleep that heavy-smelling stuff
had given her. It might be rather a useful thing to know
where to find that stuff; it was necessary to Louie's enjoyment
of the world and its humour that she should sleep at
night. It struck her as a very happy chance that chloroform
should be used in the practice of etching. She admitted
that it was rather a shame to steal from Billy again,
but she felt that she now needed that wonderful, releasing
sleep even more than when Jimmy had been born.</p>

<p>An hour later she left Billy's with the ribbed blue bottle
in her pocket.</p>

<p>The remainder of the week also was gay; so was the next
week, though perhaps with a slightly diminishing gaiety.
But the level was restored again when Roy once more
turned up at her flat, again on a Saturday afternoon.
Really she could have laughed, as they say, fit to split.
Roy, who seemed to think that you could ask a woman
to marry you without the&mdash;formality, call it&mdash;of telling
her you loved her! It was not for Louie to spoil the sport
by pointing out the inessential omission. Not that she
hesitated at all now; she had only to think of how it might
have read in the paper: "At Saint So-and-So's, on such
and such a date, by a Reverend Statue, assisted by another
Reverend Effigy, a Tanagra Figure, to a trodden-on Painting
by Billy Izzard," etc., etc. Oh no. That wasn't loving&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Roy loved Jimmy, however; and
that was perhaps a little more serious. He had handed in
his papers; he could provide for Jimmy; there was riding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
and shooting, and fishing, and the corking little pony;
but ... it was impossible, of course. Jimmy was
Louie's and nobody else's. If Jimmy must play on Saturday
afternoons with the rabble on Eelbrook Common, well,
he must; Louie would do all for him that she could. It
was a pity&mdash;especially about the pony. It disturbed Louie
a little. It disturbed her, in fact, so much that that night
she remembered something she had forgotten about for
ten days and more&mdash;the blue ribbed bottle she had stolen
from Billy. But as she had left it in her drawer at the
Consolidation she had to sleep as best she could without it.
Perhaps it was just as well. It was not a good habit. She
wondered whether Billy had missed the bottle; she would
go up again and see, taking that old painting with her.
That would square accounts a little. Certainly it was a
shame to loot Billy like that.</p>

<p>She went up to Billy's with the study. Billy received it
absently. And she was glad that Billy had a code, for he
was grave again, and seemed all but on the point of talking
seriously to her, code or none. But it blew over. He
asked her whether she'd noticed him with a bottle of chloroform
one night; he'd lost one; stupid thing to be careless
about; must be somewhere; had Louie seen him with it,
cleaning a plate?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," said Louie.</p>

<p>"Well, it may turn up. Thanks for the canvas. To
tell you the truth I rather wanted it. Merely as painting
it's&mdash;<i>knuk</i>!" Billy made a delectable little foreign gesture.</p>

<p>"I'm no judge of things as painting," said Louie.
"And&mdash;I say&mdash;Billy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know that I haven't changed my mind about
not sitting&mdash;if you asked me very nicely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Billy looked gravely at her again. "Oh, it doesn't
matter. I'd rather you didn't. I think I can manage.
You'd do far better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked hard at her, but the code held.</p>

<p>"To do what?" said Louie.</p>

<p>"Well, not to sit," said Billy, turning away.</p>

<p>Louie felt ridiculously touched; nevertheless, much as
she liked his loyalty, she wasn't going to talk about Roy.
"Thanks, Bill," she said simply. "You're a good sort."
And there the matter dropped. Neither for Billy nor for
anybody else did she ever sit again.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that so slight a thing as an indisposition
of Mr. Stonor should obscure the mock-sun of Louie's
gaiety as if a vapour had crept across it; but so it was.
Occasionally urgent messages were taken to Iddesleigh
Gate at night; usually Mr. Stonor took them; but one day
Mr. Stonor left at lunch-time and did not come back that
day. Sir Julius himself, who had had dinner sent in that
night from a restaurant, sent for Louie and gave her certain
papers and instructions. As soon as she learned the errand
she asked whether nobody else could go instead. She
invented an improbable engagement.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Sir Julius said, "but I want Whitlock&mdash;I
shall have to wait here myself till you come back. If
you could go, and give them to Mr. Jeffries himself&mdash;nobody
else&mdash;&mdash;" That was as near as Sir Julius ever came
to a direct command.</p>

<p>So, as Evie Jeffries had seen Louie's home, Louie was
now to see hers.</p>

<p>She went reluctantly, by bus, changing at the bottom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Park Lane. For days she had not seen Jim; she did not
want to see him now. Therefore, though go she must, she
would not sit down; she would not lift her veil; she would
be in and out of his house again as quickly as ever she
could. She passed the Marble Arch, and at Lancaster
Gate got down and walked. She reached Jim's vast and
tomblike house.</p>

<p>At the word "Consolidation" the man who opened the
door said: "This way, please," and led her along a low-lighted
hall, round a staircase the outspread double wings
of which resembled some huge alighting architectural bird,
and along a narrower passage to the library. At the touch
of a switch the room broke into a softly masked glow of
light. "Please to sit down," said the servant; but Louie
stood by the great writing-table, looking towards the door.
Evie had taken stock of her dwelling; Louie looked only
towards the door of Jim's library.</p>

<p>Then, as the door was opened, she pushed up her veil
after all. Jim came in.</p>

<p>He placed a chair for her; she still refused to sit. She
continued to stand even when it appeared that the papers
she had brought would require some examination. As she
stood, a bell, not unlike that of a muffled telephone, sounded
for a moment and then ceased. It was followed by a tap
on the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Jim, without looking up.</p>

<p>Evie Jeffries entered, dressed as if for a State ball.</p>

<p>Even had Louie not seen her face, the touch of her hand
would have told her what had happened. Evie was back
again exactly where she had been; the only difference was
that she now hated Louie the more that she had abased herself
before her. Many times on that other Saturday afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Louie had begged Evie to go; now she longed to fly
herself. After another minute Jim put it into her power
to do so. He rose and returned the signed papers.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, and added, turning to Evie, "I
don't know whether Miss Causton's had supper?"</p>

<p>Evie's face lighted up as artificially as if there too a
switch had turned up masked lights.</p>

<p>"Yes; won't you let me have them lay a tray for you,
'Miss' Causton? It won't be any trouble," she said.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Louie. "Please don't come to
the door, Mr. Jeffries."</p>

<p>He came, however.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said, as the door was held open for her
to pass out.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Louie.</p>

<p>She remembered afterwards that she noticed, out in
Oxford Street again, a sandwichman bearing an illuminated
board with the announcement of some concert or entertainment
upon it. Pasted across the device was a strip
of paper with the words "To night" upon it. The date
was the sixteenth of May. At midday on the day following,
Louie, coming out of Mr. Whitlock's room, saw Jim
advancing as if to come in. He saw her, stared hard at
her for a moment, paused irresolutely, and then turned abruptly
and walked away again. She watched his back,
shaped like a church-door, but bowed as if with a load too
great for him, disappear in the direction of his own room.
He had made no attempt to conceal the deliberate avoidance.
She half expected, though she knew not why, that
he would send for her presently. He did not. She was
infinitely glad. Something, she was perfectly sure, had
happened between him and his wife. It was the first time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
he had not sought her aid. Had he, now that it was too
late, told her? Had he realised that it was too late to tell
her? Had he, realising this, determined to take his last
risk and to tell her nevertheless? Or had something happened
that had at last unsealed his eyes so that he now saw
with a clearness as merciless as that of Louie herself?</p>

<p>Louie could not tell. She only saw his face again, the
face of a man suddenly old as he realised his defeat, and
his disappearing back, hunched under a burden that was
crushing him at the last.</p>

<p class="center b1 p2">§<i>b</i></p>

<p>"If I were you, Miss Causton, I should leave early to-night,"
said Mr. Whitlock that afternoon.</p>

<p>Louie looked up inquiringly from her desk.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you <i>want</i> to make it a matter of conscience!
But Mr. Jeffries is giving a party to-night, and both Sir
Julius and I will be leaving early."</p>

<p>He nodded pleasantly as he dropped his hint, and left
her. Louie resumed her work.</p>

<p>It was a report of phosphate deposits, but it had been
worked over before and needed little attention; or at all
events it got little. At five o'clock Louie gathered the
sheets together and put them into the drawer of her table.
As she did so some object at the back of the drawer knocked.
She thrust in her hand. It was the forgotten bottle of
chloroform.</p>

<p>"I'd better throw that down the basin," Louie muttered.</p>

<p>"I think, Mrs. Jeffries, that you and Roy between you
put me a little beside myself for a day or two. Much better
not to have things like that lying about; to have 'em's
sometimes to use 'em. I'll throw it away now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>But as she was rising, one of the telephone girls brought
her a cup of tea and a biscuit, and she closed the drawer
again. The girl began to talk. She was Ivy Warner, the
operator who would talk to her "boys" over the telephone
if she wanted. Louie, as a matter of fact, always admired
the skill with which she did this. A yard away not a
word would be audible, and yet Miss Warner would be
carrying on a flirtation in Brighton or Bournemouth under
the eye of Mr. Stonor himself.</p>

<p>"Well, how's Harold?" said Louie, smiling over her
cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all pleased with himself; backed three
winners to-day, one at thirty to one, a gift; like to see
him? He's coming up this evening," Miss Warner replied.
"I'd a chin with him a quarter of an hour ago;
dinner at seven-thirty, at the Troc; no steak-and-fried and
a small dark lager when a thirty-to-one creeps home! He's
bringing a friend, too; a dasher, Harold says; he's almost
afraid to introduce him; and Daisy says she really must
give her steady a show to-night. Know anybody?"</p>

<p>Louie thought for a moment. It was a thing she had
never done before. She gave Ivy a sidelong look. Again
she had the hunger to go somewhere, to see lights, hear
music, smell the cigarettes of men.</p>

<p>"Do you care to take me?" she said.</p>

<p>Ivy was surprised. "You?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not if I should spoil sport&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rather not! Do come! What a lark! I'll get on
to Harold again now. You really mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good egg!" cried Ivy, glad to make up her party and
to improve her relations with her business superior at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
same time. "I didn't really want Daisy, you see. Of
course they do talk loud at the Troc, but Daisy's just a <i>ti</i>ny
bit ... well, a perfect stranger had the cheek to come up
to our table and speak to her the last time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ivy ran jubilantly off to ring up Harold again.</p>

<p>Louie told herself it was a stupid thing to do; she was
getting into the habit of loitering about late at night, heedless
of Jimmy. But she had promised, and would go. If
she didn't she would only be mopishly thinking, and, after
all, she would be no more out of place with Harold's dashing
friend than Evie Jeffries would be in another place
much about the same time. Perhaps the dasher for Evie
and Jim's guests for herself would have been more fitting,
but no matter. She would be a dasher too. She wondered
how Ivy was describing her dashing self to Harold over the
telephone.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock she made herself ready and left the
Consolidation with Ivy.</p>

<p>She retained no very clear recollection afterwards of the
gaieties of that evening, but the little she did remember
arrested her a little. She had a confused impression of the
lights and tables and pilastered walls of the Trocadero as
of a bright beckoning vista, stretching before her as the
white road stretches before the knapsacked and stout-booted
walker. She knew that many girls went that way....
The air was heavy with the smell of coffee, smoke, dishes,
scent; Harold's friend was a Hebrew "killer," and reminded
her of Miss Levey; noisily he claimed the privilege,
which Harold noisily disputed, of paying for everything;
and the waiter contemptuously accepted a tip of a sovereign
from him. Perhaps he was the same cavalier who had
resented Daisy's loudness; at all events he appeared to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
in Louie's quietness another&mdash;or perhaps the same&mdash;meaning;
and Louie had to move her chair and to change her
attitude at the table. Afterwards they went to the Alhambra;
it was Ivy who cried out at the sight of two cabs
and refused to go unless they all went together. At the
Alhambra Louie was afraid she was rather a wet blanket;
she declined to "take a walk round" and remained seated
in her stall; but Harold's friend was fickle as well as dashing,
for by-and-by she had a glimpse of him with another
lady, who had not dined with them at the Trocadero. She
wondered how Evie Jeffries had got on&mdash;or "got off," to
use an expression of Kitty Windus's.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;perhaps it was this thought of Evie elsewhere
that did it&mdash;she got up, sought the cloakroom, and walked
out of the place. She went home, once more quietly and
steadily thinking of that vista of lights and cigar smoke
and laughing mouths and gilded pilasters&mdash;the way so
many girls went.</p>

<p>The row she expected with Ivy in the morning was not
a moment delayed. It began in the lift in which they
both happened to ascend together.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Ivy stiffly. "I hope you got
home in good time last night."</p>

<p>Louie waited until the liftman had clashed the doors to
behind them; then, "I'd a headache," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it's better than having one in the morning,"
said Ivy, more icily still. "All the same, there is
such a thing as playing the game when you go out with
people."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I oughtn't to have come," said Louie,
walking with the angry girl to the telephone exchange,
where the lights on the great switchboard came and went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
like the sparks at the back of a gate. They were coming
and going with great rapidity that morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>much</i> obliged for your company, I'm sure," Ivy
broke out, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sssh!" came from a girl who stretched the rubber
worms.</p>

<p>"Sssh yourself, Daisy Dawson&mdash;time you knew how to
speak into a phone by this time!" snapped Ivy.</p>

<p>But another and a louder "Sssh!" came from another
girl, and suddenly Mr. Stonor's head appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Quiet there!" he rapped out, and withdrew his head
again.</p>

<p>"Sssh, Ivy&mdash;haven't you heard?" Daisy Dawson said
softly.</p>

<p>Ivy's own voice dropped. "What?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"About Mr. Jeffries."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stonor came in again&mdash;but not before Louie had
heard Daisy whisper the word "dead."</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered the face of the liftman. She
clutched Mr. Stonor's arm. He looked at her. There was
no need to ask.</p>

<p>Dead!</p>

<p>Slowly she walked to her own table behind the screen.</p>

<p>The place was at once busier and more hushed than
usual. Presently Mr. Whitlock passed. Mr. Whitlock
was thirty-five; he looked fifty. Louie only asked him a
single question: "Is it in the papers?" He nodded and
passed on. She sought a messenger.</p>

<p>It was on the right-hand middle page. It had happened
at one o'clock in the morning; cerebral hæmorrhage. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
very evening he had given a dinner-party; followed a short
interview with Sir Peregrine Campbell, one of the guests;
but Mr. Robson, of the Board of Trade, had declined to be
seen. There would be no inquest. Heartfelt sympathy
was extended to his widow. Half-a-column of "career"
closed the announcement. The early edition of the evening
paper for which she sent out had it all over again.</p>

<p>Dead!</p>

<p>Another absence!</p>

<p>Slowly she turned the paper and began at the beginning
again.</p>

<p>Jim dead!</p>

<p class="p2">That night Louie fetched Jimmy from his cot into her
own bed. It was not, she felt, for comfort for herself;
she had a strange feeling that she ought to be comforting
Jimmy. Jimmy slept, but, her eyes alternately very
widely open and very tightly closed in the dark, she whispered
to him.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to look after ourselves now," she
whispered to the sleeping child. "I don't think we care
to go and see him, do we? I daresay she wouldn't refuse
it, but we won't go. That was his wife, who said she'd
a little boy like you, and of course we're all very sorry for
her. She did give him all she had; she said she'd die for
him; but of course that's only a way people have of speaking
when they mean they love somebody very much. Nobody
wants her to die for him really; that would only be two
dead instead of one; and she won't actually die.... And
she'd a sad thing happen once before. Nobody ever
knew about that really except me and him; she didn't
know; if she did she might die really then. People have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
to be careful, they say, when they've once had a terrible
shock. It's rather funny though, Jimmy, that mother
shouldn't feel very much of a shock. Of course I didn't
expect it, but as soon as it happened it seemed as if it had
been bound to happen. That's queer&mdash;and I don't know
that I wouldn't have preferred the shock."</p>

<p>She continued her curious consolation of the sleeping
boy:</p>

<p>"Poor Jimmy&mdash;poor mother! He looked beaten yesterday&mdash;done&mdash;but
I didn't think.... One never does think
till afterwards.... Ah, but mother did, once, a long time
ago! Mother danced with him once, and knew then&mdash;and
the next time she saw him Jimmy was quite a big
boy. If she could only have seen him a few times in between,
she doesn't know what she could have done, but she
would have done something, and then by-and-by he would
have blessed her for it&mdash;she's sure, quite sure he would....
And there she was, with some terrible people at a
music hall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She choked a little.</p>

<p>Even had it been proposed to her, she did not think she
would have gone to see Jim. That was another woman's
affair; Louie's part in him had nothing to do with what
remained now. Not that she was so absurd as to tell herself
she had lost nothing; even when it is only yours to
look at, or perhaps to put your arms about just once, a
body counts for something; but the other woman had had
nothing but that. "Nothing but" was perhaps a queer
way of putting it; for that "nothing but" Louie might
perhaps have given all the rest; but all the same it was not
very much her business now. Her business now, like the
other woman's, was to jog on just the same, the one in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
empty mansion, the other one it didn't much matter where.
Again she whispered to Jimmy.</p>

<p>"How thankful I am that I didn't tell her&mdash;something!
Oh, I don't think I could bear her to die for him as she said
she would! And I do hope he's not been so foolish as to&mdash;leave
anything about; anything that might tell her, I
mean; she can't bear what I can bear. But he wouldn't.
He wouldn't cover it all up so cleverly to go and uncover
it himself. I always knew it would happen if that insect
got in his way; Jim wouldn't think twice about it, except
how to make himself safe.... Was it Kitty Windus who
told me that about him&mdash;about his father having been
an English merchant captain and his mother a Corsican
woman he found dancing in a sailors' café in Marseilles?
If it wasn't Kitty I dreamed it; mother's done a most foolish
lot of dreaming; but it must have been Kitty. They
say they do that kind of thing in Corsica. I shall never
know.... Well, it doesn't matter.... Poor little
Jimmy...."</p>

<p>She deliberately tried herself, to see whether she was
capable of emotion about him. She seemed to be quite
incapable. "I'm simply callous," she thought.... She
tried several days later, on the day of his funeral; the words
she repeated to herself had no meaning for her; "gone,"
was merely a thing of four letters, "never" one of five.
The word "absence" she quite failed to understand. She
heard that Mrs. Jeffries was prostrated, but quite as well
as could be expected in the circumstances. Perhaps Mrs.
Jeffries too was repeating the words "gone" and "never."
Louie wondered whether she would marry again. It would
not surprise her.</p>

<p>Well, if Evie Jeffries could live, Louie could live.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<p>A piece of news, however, which she had from Billy
Izzard one night&mdash;this was three weeks later, but her stony
insensibility had not changed&mdash;filled her, she could not
have told why, with a quite different disquietude. It appeared
that Billy had felt himself permitted to call on
Mrs. Jeffries, and had found her (so he told Louie) busy
with her husband's private papers. Sir Julius also had
been there, to advise if advice was necessary; and Sir
Julius had been of opinion that the painful task would be
more quickly over if Mrs. Jeffries would have a number of
papers that were written in shorthand transcribed by a
clerk, if a trustworthy one could be found. "In fact, he
mentioned your name," said Billy. But it appeared that
Mrs. Jeffries knew some shorthand, had other reasons, and
so forth. She had refused to have the papers transcribed.
Naturally they had not said much with Billy there, who,
indeed, had not stayed many minutes; but he had gathered
that the papers formed some sort of a journal.</p>

<p>Louie felt her flesh grow queerly crisp. This, by the
way, was in a little restaurant not far from the Palace
Theatre. Louie had had three consecutive nights at home,
and felt that a fourth would kill her. She and Billy were
going to the Palace afterwards.</p>

<p>"A journal?" she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Well, Pepper rather thought a novel of some sort; I'd
a talk with him afterwards; but I suppose he only knows
what Mrs. Jeffries tells him. It wouldn't surprise me in
the least that poor old Jeff dabbled a bit in that sort of
thing. I'm quite sure he'd have made a painter. One
of the big sort he was, the Titian, Leonardo, Cellini sort&mdash;the
big men, who can take an art or so in their
stride."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<p>"What made Sir Julius think it might be a novel?"
Louie hoped that her new agitation did not show.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, you know as much about it as I do."</p>

<p>"And it was in shorthand?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"His own?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't say. It was in his desk though.
Why?"</p>

<p>"And you say Mrs. Jeffries is reading it herself?"</p>

<p>"Well, when Pepper suggested you&mdash;and a Miss Levey,
I remember, whoever she is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miriam Levey? Yes?" Louie said, with a jerk.</p>

<p>Billy looked hard at her. "What's the matter?" he
said abruptly. "You're as queer as Mrs. Jeffries herself
was about it."</p>

<p>"She was queer? How, queer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. How can one describe things like
that&mdash;just impressions one gets?"</p>

<p>"Did she strike you as queer because she'd perhaps read
some of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I understand it was private&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean she <i>must</i> have read some of it to find that
out?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>Again Louie had that curious crawling of her flesh. She
hesitated for a moment; then, slowly:</p>

<p>"What sort of terms are you on with Mrs. Jeffries,
Billy?"</p>

<p>Billy stared. "Oh, quite all right&mdash;I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you any influence over her?"</p>

<p>"What sort of influence?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

<p>Louie hesitated again. After all, it might be only a
fear. She went on. "Say influence enough to advise
her about reading that journal, or novel, or whatever it
is?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" said Billy. "I was his friend, hardly
hers, you see."</p>

<p>"Well, if it could be put as a matter of friendship with
him?" Louie was speaking almost feverishly now.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew exactly what you meant," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Order me another cup of coffee. That's what I can't
tell you, because I don't know myself. But let me ask
another question. Do you happen to know whether there
are any real names in this thing, whatever it is?"</p>

<p>"Really, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a moment. I'll tell you why I asked. If this is
a journal, and has names of people in it, the chances are
mine's there."</p>

<p>Billy was quick enough. He nodded. "I see; at least
I think I see. You mean about his coming in that night
and Mrs. Jeffries possibly not liking it? Well, to tell
the truth I don't think she did much. I could have bitten
my tongue out when I'd told her; but I suppose everybody
doesn't look on these things quite as we do. You mean in
a word&mdash;excuse me for putting it rather stupidly&mdash;that
she's jealous and thinks she can find out the truth? Supposing
there was any 'truth' to find out, I mean?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea. Of course there was no 'truth.'"</p>

<p>"Well? Why not let her discover that and make her
happy, poor thing? You see, he was her husband."</p>

<p>Louie winced, but continued. "That's all right as far
as it goes; but if there's one name there are probably
others."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>Billy looked sharply at her. "Other women? Jeffries?
Don't you believe it!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say women."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. And perhaps I'm altogether wrong.
But if I'm not wrong, Billy," she said earnestly, "and
you've any interest in Mrs. Jeffries at all&mdash;say interest
enough to want to spare her a shock&mdash;she oughtn't to be
allowed to read that journal&mdash;always supposing it is a
journal."</p>

<p>Billy gave a short laugh. "Really, Louie! Is this the
Surrey or Sadlers Wells?... You're not serious, are
you? Of course it's bound to be painful for her at the
best, but she's getting on very well&mdash;better than we could
have hoped."</p>

<p>Louie made a little despairing gesture. "Well, I can't
tell you any more."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's as important as all that, why don't <i>you</i>
tell her?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that either. Look here, Billy, couldn't
you find out about this for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dash it all&mdash;how can I?"</p>

<p>The saucer of Louie's coffee cup was full of ashes; she
added another butt and reached for Billy's case. She
looked Billy full in the eyes as he struck a match for her.</p>

<p>"Do you go much to Iddlesleigh Gate?"</p>

<p>"Well, just at present, you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, <i>could</i> you go? Where does all this take place?
In that library? (Yes, I've been once.)"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least that's where we were that night."</p>

<p>Still Louie looked steadily into his eyes. "Now this
really <i>is</i> Surrey and Sadlers Wells," she said. "Could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
you get those papers out of her way&mdash;anyhow&mdash;so that
she doesn't read them?"</p>

<p>Billy twinkled a little. "It takes a woman to do these
things, Louie."</p>

<p>"Suppose without asking any questions, if you did I'd&mdash;marry
Roy?" After all, to marry Roy would be no
worse than anything else now.</p>

<p>The twinkle disappeared. Billy was grave again.</p>

<p>"I'd like you to marry Roy, Louie."</p>

<p>"Well ... is it a bet?"</p>

<p>But Billy only shook his head. This was all very well
at the Surrey and Sadlers Wells, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's a physical impossibility," he said. "And if it
wasn't, I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"That's final?" said Louie, looking into his eyes for
the last time.</p>

<p>"My dear girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louie rose. "All right. Then we may as well get
across to the Palace and see Marie Lloyd."</p>

<p>Could she have said more? She did not see that she
could. The chance loomed tremendously large now that
Jim <i>had</i> been fool enough to write things after all, and
perhaps his wife was reading that journal, if it was a
journal, even then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Louie could not stop her&mdash;no power on earth could stop
her. What Jim had evidently not told her during his life
she would read for herself now that he had gone.</p>

<p>He would have done better to tell her.</p>

<p>But there: perhaps it was not a journal&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span></p>
<h2 class="p6">ENVOI</h2>

<p>"Er&mdash;Miss Causton," Sir Julius called&mdash;"can you
stay for an hour or so? No, a private affair; I
hope it's not inconvenient; thanks."</p>

<p>He was sickly white and tired-looking; Louie's feet
dragged, and her brain was as stupid as clay. She was
sorry for Sir Julius; <i>he</i> had had no preparation; as for
Louie, it seemed to her now that she had been passing
from preparation to preparation for such things for the
whole of her life. This of the morning paper was only
the latest of her fulfilments. The prophets, she thought
dully, must have been very weary men.... But on second
thoughts perhaps Sir Julius ought to have been sorry
for <i>her</i>. Even shock is better than foreknowledge.</p>

<p>For of course Sir Julius wanted her to stay in connection
with this of Mrs. Jeffries.</p>

<p>She had put on her hat and coat for departure; as if
she walked in her sleep, she passed out of Sir Julius's room
and removed them again. She bathed her face, but felt
little fresher; then she returned.</p>

<p>It was about Mrs. Jeffries. It was about them both.
Then Louie seemed to remember that Sir Julius had said
something about an article on his deceased colleague for a
Review. She supposed that was why he wanted her to
take down his words in shorthand. Unless it was for the
inquest. Gas-taps turned on, doors and windows sealed,
and so forth usually meant an inquest; and they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
not have far to look for her motive&mdash;suicide through natural
grief. It was only that morning, but it seemed an
old, old story already.</p>

<p>"'<i>Tragic Death of a Lady</i>,'" Sir Julius read out from
a newspaper....</p>

<p>Well, he wouldn't want that part taken down; indeed,
if he had only known what Louie knew, he would not have
asked her to take anything down at all. But her notebook
was on her knee and her pencil sharpened, and when Sir
Julius had finished reading her hand began to write, purely
functionally, of itself. It was no trouble to Louie whatever;
nay, her hand was hardly called upon more than her
mind; the pencil itself did it. After all, foreseeing minds
could be put to better uses than the mere recording of
things after the event.... "Sad business, sad business,"
Sir Julius was saying; and "Sad business, sad business,"
the obedient pencil wrote. But Louie wondered whether
it was so sad after all. Evie Jeffries had had a sort of
foreknowledge too; "I could die for him; you couldn't
do more," Louie remembered she had once said; yet it
was doubtful whether she had died for love of him after all.
Call it gas-taps, or the shock of discovering that Jim had
been her lover's executioner....</p>

<p>Still, she had died, from whatever reason, and she had
been quite right in saying that Louie could have done no
more.</p>

<p>It was strange the way the pencil wrote of itself. "A
page of notes in her husband's shorthand has been found
under one of the pillars of the writing-table," it wrote, and
it omitted, as if it had been endowed with Louie's own
intelligence, Sir Julius's interpolated remark, "I've got
that page of notes, by the way." Mr. Whitlock had described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
to Louie one day a contrivance called a tele-writer;
a pen dipped itself into a bottle of ink and wrote, unassisted,
a telegraphed message; they were new, and they
hadn't got them at the Consolidation yet; but they were
putting them into some of the post offices, Mr. Whitlock
had said. Her pencil moved like the pen of a tele-writer.
She watched it, fascinated. It was writing as Sir Julius
talked, about Jim now.</p>

<p>"&mdash;lived an intense crowded life too. I should say at a
guess there weren't many things he hadn't done at one time
and another, short of a murder or a matrimonial infidelity.
Don't think he could have been tempted to do that. One
woman could do anything she liked with him, but the
others wouldn't have much chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Very little chance, Louie thought. That, in a sense,
had been the tragedy of it all. Louie knew more about
that than Sir Julius; Louie had once said, "Come, come!"
to him, in tones that might have brought angels from above
and devils from below running for love, but it had not made
a ha'p'orth of difference to Jim. Sir Julius seemed to be
praising him for it; Louie was not sure that she could
exactly do that; she could almost as soon have mocked him
for it; but you neither mock nor praise a blind man merely
because he is blind. It was funny that Sir Julius, with
not very much to boast about himself, should set up an idol
of faithfulness; and not just for somebody else to worship
either; that was the funny part; men did that kind of
thing; sinned, and yet worshipped, and called it "the
maintenance of an ideal." They honoured Joseph, and
winked when his back was turned. Perhaps they made
much of him because of his rarity. Well, it was all the
same to Potiphar's wife....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<p>But all at once something seemed to have happened to
the pencil. It was tele-writing very furiously. Sir
Julius was reading from another piece of paper; Louie
fancied, somehow, that it might be the piece that had got
wafted under the pillar of Jim's desk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>&mdash;show him that red thing on the floor and that
curved thing on the door.</i>"</p>

<p><i>But now Archie in his turn seemed to have become
divided. He had turned suddenly white. But
an habitual pertness still persisted in his tongue.
I don't think this had any relation whatever to
the physical peril he seemed at last to have realised
he was in. I stood over him huge and black
as Fate.... "Spare him if you can," that
generous bloodthirsty devil in me muttered
quickly....</i></p>

<p>"<i>Merridew," I said heavily, "you'll disappear to-morrow
morning&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Shall I?" he bragged falteringly....</i>
</p></div>

<p>He seemed to have hanged him, then; "that curved
thing on the door" evidently meant a hook. That was
rather revolting; these were the things about murder that
Louie had not wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Sort of grim tale he would write," said Sir Julius to
the pencil; "and of course&mdash;<i>de mortuis</i> and so on&mdash;but he
did marry the wrong woman. I suppose they're together
again now."</p>

<p>Suddenly Louie put down her notebook and pencil. Her
voice, too, as she spoke, seemed to her a sort of tele-voice.</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me just a moment?" she said. "I'm
thirsty."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>She went out. When she returned, three or four minutes
later, Sir Julius sniffed once or twice and asked her
if she had a toothache. She took up the pencil and notebook
again. Sir Julius resumed.</p>

<p>"What was I saying? Oh yes, about his marrying the
wrong woman.... But he was a mass of contradictions,
and one of 'em was that he merely idealised her. Pretty,
of course, but poor Jeffries could have done better for
himself than that. She never could bear me...."</p>

<p>Louie felt no difference yet; she did not know how long
these things took. For a moment she wondered what would
happen after ... and then it struck her as foolish to
wonder about a thing she would know so soon. She fastened
her eyes on the pencil again. It went on writing,
and Louie was thinking of her loved little Jimmy now....
She could not have done very much for him; he
might even have grown up to bear her some sort of a
grudge; Roy would adopt him; he would be far, far better
with Roy. There was a pony out at grass for him now;
he would ride and shoot and fish, and his father would
send him into the army; and perhaps there was already
a baby girl somewhere in the world who would one day be
his wife&mdash;the right wife. "Was die Mutter träumt, das
vollbringt der Sohn...."</p>

<p>It was far, far better....</p>

<p>"Well," the pencil wrote, "there's nothing to be said
now, poor creatures.... Funny smell in here, Miss Causton;
I'll smoke if you don't mind."</p>

<p>Sir Julius lighted a cigar. Its penetrating odour
mingled with that of the sweet, releasing stuff.</p>

<p>Ah! It was coming! The pencil wrote no less
quickly, but it looked a little smaller and farther away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p>

<p>"But sometimes it made me almost angry that he hadn't
married the woman he ought...."</p>

<p>Louie felt her head sinking.... Yes, the woman he
ought....</p>

<p>That had been the real fatality....</p>

<p>Her lids dropped for a moment, and then heavily lifted
again; but she could still see the pencil&mdash;mistily&mdash;dreamily&mdash;as
if endued with a life not her own&mdash;flying on.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
